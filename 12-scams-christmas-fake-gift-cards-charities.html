however, experts warn Americans of Christmas scams that could turn their celebrations sour.</p><p>The Better Business Bureau (BBB) has outlined in jovial holiday fashion the 12 scams of Christmas that Americans should know about before purchasing goods.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000698541287.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000698541272.jpg><h2>ATTACKS ON SOCIAL MEDIA</h2><p>The BBB warns of social media ads that claim to support a charity or a free trial that in fact are scams in which victims never receive items they purchase or are charged monthly.</p><p>Others receive counterfeit items that is different from the one that was advertised.</p><p>This is the most common scam and has recorded the highest number of victims - and is why the BBB says it's best to check the business online at bbb.org.</p><h2>'PAY IT FORWARD' SCAM</h2><p>Another social media scam is a "pay it forward" (social media gift exchanges) type of scam in which people are urged to send gift cards or money to strangers in a form of Secret Santa.</p><p>Instead, people are tricked into sharing their personal information online and then sending funds to scammers expecting something in return.</p><h2>ONLINE ACCOUNTS</h2><p>Americans are warned to question emails saying their accounts are compromised, which could lead to them clicking a suspicious link and filling the scammer's website with personal data like credit card numbers and more.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><h2>HOLIDAY-THEMED APPS</h2><p>Another scam involves holiday apps, some of which are geared towards kids, that contain plenty of advertising that can contain malware.</p><h2>FAKED MIRRORED WEBSITES</h2><p>The BBB is warning Americans of another scam this holiday season: faked mirrored websites that look like other businesses you frequent.</p><p>These sites trick people into downloading malware and making false purchases while sharing private data.</p><h2>HOLIDAY "WISH LIST" ITEMS</h2><p>The BBB is asking holiday shoppers to be mindful of low-prices on luxury items such as designer bags and clothing, jewelry, and electronics.</p><p>Some popular holiday items may not be available for shipment if you order through social sites.</p><h2>SENDING FAKE SHIPPING NOTIFICATIONS</h2><p>Another scam involves sending fake shipping links to people in the hopes they click on a fishy website and download malware - or more so, miss their packages altogether.</p><h2>FREE VIRTUAL HOLIDAY EVENTS</h2><p>Other scams will have a usually free holiday event charge people money after scammers advertise the event online with a cover fee.</p><p>Americans are warned of the five following scams in what seems too good to be true deals.</p><h2>FREE GIFT CARDS</h2><p>Firstly, Americans should avoid anything that involves giving away personal information for "free gift cards."</p><h2>CHARITY SCAM</h2><p>The same goes for when sending funds to charities, where scammers take personal information and make private purchases while claiming to represent a well-known charity.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2>SEASONAL HOLIDAY JOBS</h2><p>Heartless scammers are tricking people on the job market to pay to submit applications for holiday jobs.</p><h2>PET SCAM</h2><p>The BBB also warns Americans to always see physical things in person - like never buying pet that they had not seen in person, or to avoid buying material objects like luxuery goods and designer clothes from an irreputable vendor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000698541372.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>People are still losing $500 on average due to scammers on the internet -
