Sayers, the second of three children born to Bernice and Roger, moved to Speed, Kansas, before settling in Omaha, Nebraska. He stood out in both football and track and field for Omaha Central High School, setting a state record in the long jump with a leap of 24′ 11 3/4″.</h3><h3>Sayers went on to play football at the University of Kansas, where he was twice named All-America for his abilities as a halfback and kick returner. As a junior, he set an NCAA Division I record with a 99-yard run against Nebraska, and the following year, his 96-yard kickoff return helped Oklahoma pull off an upset victory.</h3><h2>Here are the inspiring quotes of Gale Sayers</h2><p>“I was playing in the league when Ray Guy was playing in the league.
