As word of their engagement spread, suspicions circulated that Justin had proposed to Hailey just to get Selena back. Hailey, on the other hand, thinks that the engagement was the nicest thing that had happened to her. She described how everything transpired in a flash, saying:</p><p>“To be honest, I believe it was because we’re both so young. I completely understand. I never expected to marry at such a young age; I believe the time was quite quick, and I completely understand. That appeared extreme and insane, but it felt right for the two of us at the moment.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Hailey-Bieber-3.jpg alt="Hailey Bieber" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Hailey also addressed Justin’s charges, since many had previously labeled her a “homewrecker.” She stated:</p><p>“People were perplexed by the timeframe. He was not in a relationship when he and I began hooking up or anything of the type. It’s not in my nature to sabotage someone’s relationship; I was raised better than that.”</p><p>Hailey Bieber also said that although it may seem different and silly from the outside, the truth has been extremely different for Justin and her, particularly in light of Selena and the allegations that surfaced at the time. Hailey also discussed how she is often compared to other celebrities, and how she despises this aspect of her job. She stated:</p><p>“A lot of the hatred stems from things like, ‘Oh you took him,’ and the fact that he wishes he had ended up with someone else.” That’s OK; you may hope all you want, but it’s not true.”</p><p>She briefly mentioned mental health and how she was always a “people pleaser,” but how treatment and circumstances transformed her. She also spoke about her suicidal thoughts and said that she will be working on some problems for a long time.</p><p>She ended the conversation with a message to all Selena lovers. She stated:</p><p>“You do not have to like me, but I think that there may always be mutual respect between individuals.” That indicates you don’t have to say anything, in my opinion. Behind this screen is a real person with a brain and a heart, so be aware that what you say has weight.”</p><p>Hailey Bieber also said that she had an encounter with Selena Gomez after her wedding, and that is how she knows everything between the two is well.</p><h2>Hailey and Justin have been together since 2009, but they married in 2018.</h2><p>Justin and Hailey met for the first time at a fan gathering in 2009. Hailey was just 12 years old at the time. In 2011, Hailey attended another Bieber Fever event and met Justin for the second time.&nbsp;After three years, Justin and Hailey were seen going to church together, sparking dating speculations for the first time. Justin had recently split up with Selena at the time, so there was cause to suspect Hailey and Justin were dating in 2014. The duo, however, denied any romantic relationship with one other. In January 2015, Justin and Hailey Bieber were seen spending New Year’s Eve together.</p><p>They received matching tattoos later that year. Hailey Bieber was also spotted vacationing with Justin Bieber and his family towards the end of 2015.&nbsp;Even so, the two did not confirm whether they were dating. But when the pair were spotted spending New Year’s Eve 2016 in a much more romantic way, the public knew Hailey Bieber and Justin were now in a relationship, with something serious blossoming between them. However, things changed and the pair split up for a short period between February and August of 2016. Justin began hanging out with Sofia Richie about this time.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Hailey-Bieber-2.jpg alt="Hailey Bieber" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Simultaneously, rumors of the “it-couple,” Justin and Selena reuniting shocked fans in November 2017. However, their relationship did not work out. Later, in June 2018, Justin and Hailey Bieber resumed their romance. Justin proposed to Hailey one month later, in July 2018, when they were on vacation in the Bahamas.&nbsp;A few weeks later, on July 17, 2018, Hailey revealed her bridal party, confirming the couple’s impending marriage. Later that year, in September 2018, the pair moved into Justin’s Toronto house.</p><p>From calling Hailey his “wife” to Hailey changing her name on social media from Baldwin to Bieber, the pair was also photographed on the cover of Vogue. While the relationship may have been rocky at first, Hailey Bieber maintains that they are both young, and that is what she enjoys most about her marriage.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYZqSfpLhutc2tpmagkZ65psWMm6CempWneqK6w2ahrquknrtursiemZ6qXaeyra3Toqanq5ievXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
