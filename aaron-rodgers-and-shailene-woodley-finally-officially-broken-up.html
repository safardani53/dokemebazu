Neither of them was happy.”</p><p>But as the dust began to settle from the 2021 NFL season and Aaron renewed his contract with the Packers (a $150 million deal will put anyone in a better mood), he and Shailene decided to give their relationship a second chance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Unfortunately, it now looks as though the experiment failed, and Rodgers and Woodley have gone their way for a second time.</p><p>News of the split comes to us courtesy of E! News, who reports that once again, it was Shailene who decided to end the relationship.</p><p>"Shailene tried to give it another shot and was spending time with Aaron," <a href=#>an insider</a> tells the outlet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"But she quickly saw that everything was on his terms and nothing was going to change. There was no reason to continue and she’s done with it again."</p><p>"They are two very different people," a separate source tells E! News.</p><p>"They are both focused on their careers, but it took them in separate directions."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>While Aaron and Shailene might have parted ways permanently, the second insider says that the two of them are still "supportive of one another and on good terms."</p><p>It’s the latest in a long line of high-profile breakups for Rodgers, who parted ways with NASCAR driver Danica Patrick in 2020.</p><p>Prior to that <a href=#>Rodgers dated actress Olivia Munn</a> for several years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In all of those cases, the splits were amicable, and Rodgers seems to be on civil terms with most if not all of his exes.</p><p>(For evidence of this, look no further than the QB’s friendly post-game interviews with Erin Andrews, whom he also dated briefly.)</p><p>But it looks as though Rodgers’ search for the right partner will continue after yet another false start.</p><p>And if he’s as focused on his career as Shailene says he is, maybe he should complete his quest for another Super Bowl ring before he thinks any more about wedding rings.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WBcK3Aq6anZaKksaix0axkmqaUYsCprcilnKedXay8sLDLnrBmnpmjrq242Gamn56ZmLaiuMuyZJuqn6Cyr3nUqWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
