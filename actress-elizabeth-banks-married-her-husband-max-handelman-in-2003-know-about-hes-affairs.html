They met on her first day at the University of Pennsylvania on September 6, 1992. &nbsp;Banks didn’t think she would end up marrying the guy she met in college.</p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><a href=# rel=noopener>In an interview for her June cover of Allure, Banks said</a>,</p><p>I didn’t meet my husband and think, I’ve met the man I’m going to marry,&nbsp;</p><p>she said in the interview.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>I was like, He’s cute. I’ll f— him because I’m 18 and in college.</p><p>And 10 years later Max popped the question which came as a complete surprise to Elizabeth. However, <a href=# rel=noopener>the pair got married</a> on July 5, 2003, at the Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills. They read letters from their first year of dating instead of the vows.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p></p><p>Look at them now, aren’t they just adorable together. They are one of the cutest couples in Hollywood. The cute couple is blessed with two cute children both born through a surrogate. Their youngest child is named Magnus Mitchell born on November 14, 2012, and the elder child is <strong>Felix Mitchell </strong>(born March 2011).</p><p></p><p>The couple was recently <a href=#>spotted</a> on Rio’s and they were seemed to relaxed and chilled. It very rare to find a man who supports you in every step of your life and Banks is definitely one of the luckiest people to have found the one.</p><p></p><p>In the&nbsp;same&nbsp;interview with Allure, Banks said,</p><p>We have always dreamed of our life together.&nbsp; And we work together every day, and we have a lot of respect for each other on every level.&nbsp; And then there’s love.&nbsp; And then there’s lust.&nbsp; So it’s great.</p><p>Banks and the series producer, Max also own together and it’s the same company that produced Pitch Perfect. Their chemistry is just fantastic may it be as husband and wife or as co-workers. They have shown everyone the true meaning of love. A relationship that started during college and ended in a happily ever after.</p><p>Well, we wish this fantastic couple all the luck for their future and hope their marriage lasts a lifetime.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Please, leave your comments below.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-native_bottom"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FSrZirnJ%2Bie6S7zGiYnKyimsC0ecSloLOZkprBqXnBmqWkq12irrO%2ByJ6bZqCVp3qpwdKbmKecXaKuuXnHmqWdnZyirq95yKdka2hgaHqsus6wZJqan6rBbrTErGSanpaWtrO%2F</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
