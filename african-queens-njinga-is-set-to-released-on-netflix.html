She fought her realm fiercely against European strength… enslavement threatened to ruin a continent. Rising to become a lighthouse for her people.”</p><h2>Jada Pinkett Smith discusses representation in relation to African Queens: Njinga.</h2><p>In an interview with The Citizen, Pinkett Smith discussed her experience with the play and expressed her desire to “keep to the historical truths.”</p><p>She stated:</p><p>“The challenge with storytelling is that sometimes you want to take creative license and extend concepts a little bit, but I really wanted to keep to the actual realities of each individual. I simply thought it was necessary, especially because these aren’t well-known tales.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/African-Queens-Njinga-2.jpg alt="African Queens Njinga" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The 51-year-old went on to say:</p><p>“There is a wealth of historical literature about all of England’s queens, so if you wish to extend their storylines in crafting a story, the purity of their life is at our fingers. That is not true of Black African queens.”</p><p>Smith expressed her desire to “represent Black women” and noted that the audience does not frequently get to “watch or hear tales about Black queens.” She emphasized the necessity of representation, particularly for the “community to know these experiences.”&nbsp;Along with Smith, Westbrook Studios’ Miguel Melendez, Terence Carter, Jane Root, Maxine Watson, Ben Goold, and Sahara Bushue serve as executive producers. The series is written by Nnene Iwuji and Seasons of Love’s Peres Owino.</p><p></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>African Queens: Njinga</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Netflix</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYn6qZmK6vedCunJ6mo2K7q7XNoJhmoaNiwKbAjK2mZqqVobKiv8SdZKimXaOytbLLoq9o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
