It would be amazing if it were personal possessions of Alana’s that were left at June’s house.</p><p>It would be a fun twist if not everything that they thought that she had sold for drug money turned out to be gone forever.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Unfortunately, this is when Mike "Sugar Bear" Thompson and Jennifer Lamb’s sinister subplot rears its ugly head.</p><p>We see Mike invite Alana to come live with him.</p><p>And by "invite," we mean that he and Jennifer have already been filmed conspiring to try to make family court force this to happen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>At 14, Alana is smart and assertive enough to see her terrible father for the man that he is.</p><p>Even the thought of having to live with him brings her to tears, which is more than understandable.</p><p>"Sugar Bear does not want to be in my life," she points out, her voice breaking as she cries.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Jennifer Lamb has clearly wholeheartedly embraced her role on the show as a primary antagonist.</p><p>Viciously, she yells back at Alana: "You don’t want to be in his!"</p><p>Alana, realizing that her dad just wants the money that exists to provide for her, breaks down while explaining that this is about Mike, not her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"He told my mother he doesn’t want me because I’m not a boy," Alana says while weeping.</p><p>Mike walks off, either disappointed that his ploy is not working or ashamed that who he really is has been exposed on camera.</p><p>Unfortunately, this only spurs Jennifer to be even more cruel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"Your mama’s a crackhead," Jennifer matter-of-factly states.</p><p>First of all, though June did test positive for cocaine in the previous week’s episode, it sounds like she’s really more of a meth head.</p><p>And second of all, just because something may be true doesn’t mean that it needs to be said to a traumatized, distressed child.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Alana is now very visibly weeping during this agonizing confrontation.</p><p>Fortunately, she is not facing down her garbage dad or her trashy wannabe-evil-stepmom alone.</p><p>Lauryn "Pumpkin" Shannon has been taking care of Alana, and she’s not letting this farce continue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Lauryn goes off, pointing out that Mike hasn’t actually acted like a father to Alana.</p><p>In fact, he does not in any way support his daughter — Lauryn does that. Alana’s own money does that.</p><p>Lauryn and Jennifer lay into each other, the latter upset that her dastardly plan isn’t working out as she had hoped.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>We don’t know how much of the drama is staged and how much of this is real, raw emotion — we imagine that it’s a blend of the two.</p><p>But it looks like production had to step in between the two of them to prevent a physical brawl from breaking out.</p><p>Wow. And the trailer isn’t over yet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>We also briefly see June.</p><p>As we know, she did not voluntarily participate in most of this season.</p><p>But editors are milking what little footage they do have of her for all that it is worth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Geno starts talking about money, mentioning $150,000 on camera before June silences him, reminding him to hush.</p><p>They have blown through a tremendous amount of cash, much of which was spent on drugs.</p><p>June then admits that she is scared, which is not surprising.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Despite her family’s hopes for her to break things off with her toxic boyfriend, June and Geno are still solidly together.</p><p>The two hold hands in a small display of mutual affection.</p><p>Sadly, June and Geno both have a long way to go.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>We know that some viewers think that the teases mean that June will totally get better this season.</p><p>The reality is that even early this year — months after these episodes were filmed — June and Geno were still struggling, and in Florida.</p><p>(For reference, Alana’s fake-snorting-cocaine scandal was in August of 2019)</p><p>She and Geno have a long, difficult journey ahead of them to get sober and make things right with her family.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY6voJ2dn6h8orjAp5hmrJikurG%2Fzqdkm6qVlri0ecOorqdlkah6q7HNp6CfnaJiuaK5wWaqnKqVmrCpsdJmsKitomK6ornArGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
