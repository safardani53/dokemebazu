Since then, the New York native has been extra intentional about spending time with both his wife and daughter.</p><p>“We have date nights and time with [Olympia], and I try to be present for that,” the entrepreneur told Us on Monday. “That, honestly, is the thing [Williams] cares the most about. … The thing that probably should go viral, but never will, is just dads or husbands spending that time and really committing [to] it when they are with their families, being present.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Alexis-Ohanian-Serena-Williams-daughter-Olympia.jpg><p>Earlier that day, the five-time Wimbledon winner admitted that<a href=#> she wasn’t sure she would ever have kids</a> before Olympia’s arrival. “Becoming a mom is something that I’ve always wanted to do, but I was getting older and [it was] not really going to happen,” the Queen of the Court author told reporters at&nbsp;New York Fashion Week’s The Shows, The Talk’s Breakfast of Champions.&nbsp;“I love being her mom, and it’s such a great feeling. For me, she’s the best thing that’s happened to me and I’ve had so many amazing things happen to me, so … that’s really saying a lot.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Williams went on to say that her daughter’s existence still surprises her. “The other day, we were at dinner and I’m like, ‘How am I a mom?!’ How did that happen?’” the athlete recalled. “I remember being pregnant, but it feels like a lifetime ago. I was just, like, hanging out with my friends, and I was like, ‘I’m a mom! It’s weird!’”</p><p>With reporting by Nicki Gostin</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaapJWttrR5zqGYp6GRo3q0tMCrnKxlmJ7Abq3NnWSsnaKau6J51qKjpaGRosBusMCunqGslad6sLjYpqeimaNirqW70ZqZpZ1do7K4ecyio56rpKS7pnnWnmScmZ6peqix02acp6elnLVuu8Vmn56qXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
