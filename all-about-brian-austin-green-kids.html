First of all, they make it easy.&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>They're incredible kids</a>," the&nbsp;Dancing with the Stars&nbsp;pro said. "Brian and Megan did such an amazing job. Kass is also an amazing kid. There's been no resistance, I have a beautiful relationship with them."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In July 2023, Green recruited his kids to help him <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>propose to Burgess</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We head into our bedroom and I start to get these feelings," Burgess recalled on the couple's podcast,&nbsp;Oldish. "The kids come in and Noah is holding Zane and Journey is holding this little red&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Cartier box</a>.

Green and Marcil began dating in the 1990s and were engaged in 2001, but <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>ended their relationship</a> not long after Kash was born.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kassius was the best man</a> at Green's 2010 wedding to Fox. He was also reportedly the only guest at the wedding — unsurprising since Green had previously told PEOPLE that they were planning a small wedding. "Originally we were talking elopement and now we might have a few people there," Green said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over the years, Green and Marcil have taken their co-parenting drama public. In November 2018, Marcil alleged that Green and Fox had <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cut Kassius out</a> of their lives completely. In a lengthy Instagram post, she explained that she spent several years fighting the two in court. "12 years ago I was served legal papers," she wrote. "And then spent 8 years+ defending myself and my son in custody court in response to his father & his stepmother trying to get full custody (that means I would have seen my son four days a month) and then asking me to pay them child support."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Marcil went on to claim that Kassius <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>didn't have a bedroom</a> in Green and Fox's home, and added, "He hasn't ever seen Megan again or met his youngest brother. He's not allowed to know where they live anymore. Isn't invited to see them on holidays. Not even Father's Day."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In February 2023, Marcil responded to a comment about Green on social media, claiming the exes "didn't & don't co-parent" and she "raised my son alone." The claims <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>prompted Green to refute Marcil's "lies"</a> on Instagram.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I can't tell you all how frustrating it is to read continued lies from a 50+ year old woman on social media like she is still in high school," he wrote on his Instagram Story. "She has never in her life been someone to walk the walk. Talk is cheap. Megan and I bust our asses to give Kass a well rounded childhood since his mom was rarely there. I'm assuming that's why she posts so much of him now. When will she just GO AWAY."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-noah-shannon-green-11></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Noah Shannon Green, 11</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Megan Fox Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Green and Fox welcomed their first son together, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Noah Shannon Green</a>, on Sept. 27, 2012.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In November 2018, Fox surprised fans by posting a picture of all three of their kids in their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Halloween costumes</a>. Noah, then 6 years old, appeared to be dressed as a zombie cheerleader — similar to the character his mom played in Jennifer's Body.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In December 2020, Green spoke about the family's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>tough time with home-schooling</a> during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. He said that Noah found it particularly difficult, explaining, "We have a pod of six other kids, because our 8-year-old, he just wasn't into the remote learning at all. Sitting in front of a computer and doing that, that just wasn't his thing. ... I think some kids need the socialization. Like, they really need to be with other kids."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Noah is also "really into fashion" and has been wearing dresses since he was 2. "He designs, he draws outfits. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>He's very talented</a>," Fox told InStyle in 2021. A few years earlier, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Green defended his son's fashion choices</a>, saying, "I've heard from some people that they don't agree with him wearing dresses. To them I say, I don't care. He's 4 and if he wants to wear it then he wears it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He continued, "It's his life, they're not my clothes. … I feel like at 4 at 5, that's a time when he should be having fun. He's not harming anyone wearing a dress. So if he wants to wear a dress, good on him."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bodhi-ransom-green-9></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Bodhi Ransom Green, </strong>9</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Megan Fox Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Feb. 12, 2014, Green and Fox welcomed their second son together, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bodhi Ransom Green</a>. Bodhi is just 16 months younger than brother Noah.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead of Bodhi's arrival, Fox told PEOPLE that she was worried about how Noah would react to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>being a big brother</a>. She explained that Noah is "sensitive" and added, "I think that he's going to be a nurturer. It's a lot to expect … I think he's going to be an amazing big brother with time."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Green and Fox haven't shared much about Bodhi with the public, but in October 2015, Fox posted a photo of her second son in a now-deleted Instagram. "Bodhi: Stunner. Clown. Unicorn," she wrote.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A year later, Fox told PEOPLE that she was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>limiting TV and technology</a> for Bodhi and Noah. "It's actually really bad for their brain development, and I'm trying to breed, like, superheroes," Fox said. "I don't want them to get f----- up brains. So I just suck it up, and it's hard, and one of us is always doing something. We don't get a lot of rest time, but I know it's better for them."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-journey-river-green-7></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Journey River Green, 7</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Megan Fox Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Aug. 4, 2016, Green and Fox welcomed their third child, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Journey River Green</a>. Fox had <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>filed for divorce</a> from Green one year earlier, but in July 2016 a family friend told PEOPLE that the two were very much <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>back together</a>. "Brian and Megan are living together in Malibu with their boys," the source said. "They have been getting along and seem very happy. They are just waiting for the baby to arrive."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In June 2016, Fox told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jimmy Kimmel</a> that she could tell her then-unborn son was a "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>super genius</a>" like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Elon Musk</a>, and even said that the family was moving because that's what Journey wanted. "This baby [wants] me to live somewhere else," she said. "So we're moving to a whole different place in Los Angeles because I feel like that's where this baby wants to be raised."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though Green and Fox separated in March 2020, the former couple has since spoken about their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>healthy co-parenting relationship</a>. According to Green, the exes "co-parent really well together." He added that they "don't fight over time with the kids" and "try and alternate holidays between Christmas Day, Christmas Eve."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Green continued, "I'm very aware of — and so is she — that our schedules are insane.

Less than two years later, the couple <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>announced that they were expecting</a> a baby together. Their son, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Zane Walker Green</a> was born on June 28, 2022.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A few days after Zane's arrival, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Burgess shared a photo</a> of Zane sleeping on her chest. Green later said that Burgess was a natural at parenting. "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Zane's amazing</a>, Sharna's amazing," he explained. "It's been an amazing experience, it really has."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Brian told PEOPLE that his older sons were excited about their newest sibling. "They check on Sharna every day and they rub her belly and talk to the baby," he said. "They're counting down the days!
