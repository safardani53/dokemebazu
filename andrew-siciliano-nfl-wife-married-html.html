He carried a passion for sports from a very young age as his whole family shares the same interest. In fact, throughout his time at Syracuse University, he served as Assistant Sports Director at the student-run radio network, WAER. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p dir=ltr>Andrew, age 44 soon got the role of a dual anchor/reporter at WMAQ-670 AM after his academics. The reporter was honored with several awards, along with two AIR awards for Best Sports Reporter and Best Anchor during his time at WMAQ. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr>It wasn’t long before he started to hold hosting duties at FOX Sports Net in 2000 and left the network in 2011 after contributing to FSN programming that included FSN’s Final score as well. &nbsp;Today, the reporter serves as a host on NFL Network and mainly hosts the NFL’s daily news program, Up to the Minute including all of its afternoon breaking news coverage.</p><p dir=ltr>His career has led him to earn a hefty amount of salary as well, as the average salary in NFL ranges from $104,642 to $145,656. So it’s safe to say to say that his net worth resides within millions. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h3 dir=ltr><strong>Andrew Siciliano Gets Mocked For His Ears&nbsp;</strong></h3><p dir=ltr>While he is quite successful in his sports reporting career, Andrew is often made fun of for his ears that stand out as prominent ears.

For one, nobody has ever bothered to poke him to spill on his possibly married life on social media sites. And for other, he isn’t exactly a fan of talking about his personal life.</p><p dir=ltr>But the thing that is confirmed is that he is not married. And if you’re wondering why we mentioned his ‘possibly married life’ earlier, it’s because he has already reached the age of 44 and it’s only feasible to make a guess about his mystery wife.</p><p dir=ltr>Anyway, for the minority of the people who even wonder a bit if Andrew is enjoying serene married life with a wife, the answer is no. And the ladies still have a chance to warm into the anchor’s heart. &nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGiknpyZlnyiusOrnLBlo56wqrjImqWoZZ6buW7DyJ%2BcZqWRp7%2BqscNnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
