I wasn’t OK at all,”&nbsp;Michelle said.</p><p>“And producers were in my room … seeing how bad I was hurting and I asked you for a conversation, and it was not a conversation where I was trying to change your trajectory or trying to change your mind or fight for you. It was a conversation so that I could have my inner peace when I left Pennsylvania, and you said no.”</p><p>To that, Matt responded: “If I would have known that this is how you were feeling in that moment, then I would have fought to have that conversation. Just in terms of there being any doubt in how I felt about you, what I can tell you is that when you showed up when you did, it was a breath of fresh air, and I always tell people who ask that you weren’t late. You were right on time.”</p><p>Despite heartbreak following The Bachelor, Michelle is back and better than ever as her search for true love is right around the corner.</p><h2><strong>ANOTHER CHANCE AT LOVE</strong></h2><p>According to Reality Steve, Michelle's season will be filmed in Palm Springs,&nbsp;<a href=#>California.</a></p><p>While the exact location of the filming is unknown, Steve revealed that he does not believe that it will take place at La Quinta, where Clare Crawley and Tayshia Adams’ season was filmed last year.</p><p>Part of this <a href=#>upcoming season</a> will also be filmed in&nbsp;<a href=#>Minnesota.</a></p><p>Steve revealed that for most of August 2021, Young's season will be filmed at the Marquette Hotel in Minneapolis.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>men competing for Michelle's heart</a>&nbsp;include:</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><ul><li>Alec, 29, Forest, VA</li><li>Brandon J, 26, Portland, OR</li><li>Brandon K, 29, Sulphur, LA</li><li>Brett, 29, Houston, TX</li><li>Bryan, 30, Houlton, WI</li><li>Casey, Parkland, FL</li><li>Christopher G, 27, Halifax, Nova Scotia</li><li>Chris S, 28, New Orleans, LA</li><li>Clayton, 28, Eureka, MO</li><li>Daniel, 26, Austin, TX</li><li>Edward, 27, Brownsville, TX</li><li>Eric, 25, Bridgewater, NJ</li><li>Garrett, 33, Salt Lake City, UT</li><li>Jack, 30, Greensborough, NC</li><li>Jamie, 32, Tacoma, WA</li><li><a href=#>Joe</a>, 28, Minneapolis, MN</li><li>Joel, 31, Prescott, AZ</li><li>Jomarri, 26, Portland, OR</li><li>Leroy, 27, Durham, NC</li><li>LT, 38, Bellevue, WA</li><li>Martin 28, Cordoba, Argentina</li><li>Michael, 30, Omaha, NE</li><li>Mollique, 36, Jameshill, Jamaica</li><li><a href=#>Nayte</a>, 27, Winnipeg, MB</li><li>Olumide, 28, Woodland Park, NJ</li><li>Pardeep, 30, Brooklyn, NY</li><li>Peter, 26, Bellmore, NY</li><li>PJ, 30, Austin, TX</li><li>Rick, 32, Munroe Falls, OH</li><li>Rodney, 29, Rancho Cucamonga, CA</li><li>Romeo, 32, New York, NY</li><li>Ryan, 30, Sanger, CA</li><li>Spencer, 25, Cleveland, OH</li><li>Trevor, 26, Rocklin, CA</li><li>Will, 29, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic</li></ul><p>The Bachelorette premieres on October 19, 2021 at 8:00 pm EST on ABC.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000681286173.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000668551147.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000680090257.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Bachelorette Michelle Young stuns in tight gold gown AND scores a basket in college athlete's new teaser for season 13</span><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hraGWCc4CXaJmam5iaubC%2BxK2rnmWdnrCpsculnGaxn6q7qHnCqKWtnaOprq%2FA0maknqZdo8KlsYysnJqrn6N6tb7AoqOeql8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
