Pictures</span></figure><p>Before children squished and squeezed Cabbage Patch Kids in the early '80s (why were babies growing in a cabbage patch, anyway?) and played with little <a href=#>Polly Pockets in the '90s</a>, toy company Mattel introduced the world to a true legend in 1959. Her name is Barbara Millicent Roberts, but you can just call her Barbie.</p><p>From Twist 'n' Turn Barbie to the iconic Malibu Barbie, there's no denying that the model-like toy has had a major impact on culture, fashion, and entertainment.</p><p>Speaking of entertainment, Barbie is coming to the big screen in 2023. From Oscar-nominated director Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird), <a href=#>Barbie</a> will see Oscar nominee <a href=#>Margot Robbie</a> (I, Tonya) play the titular toy. Naturally, Oscar nominee <a href=#>Ryan Gosling</a> (La La Land) plays <a href=#>Barbie's boyfriend, Ken</a>.</p><p>Though Barbie is a children's toy (skinny legend <a href=#>Trixie Mattel</a> begs to differ), that doesn't necessarily mean Barbie is a family-oriented film. Let's discuss the movie's rating.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube/Warner Bros.

However, maybe you should leave the little ones at home, as the comedy boasts a PG-13 MPAA rating.</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Motion Picture Association</a>, a PG-13 rating implores parents to be cautious, as the film in question may feature content inappropriate for pre-teenagers.</p><p>If you're looking for kids' Barbie movies, we suggest checking out 2002's Barbie as Rapunzel and 2004's Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper. You know, if you want to ensure that your children are cultured.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The full trailer for 'Barbie' is officially here, as well as official cast posters.</h2><p>On April 4, Twitter went hot pink with excitement over the official Barbie trailer and cast posters dropping.
