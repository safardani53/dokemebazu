Thankfully, more Hollywood stars than ever before are preaching that message, and they won’t let body-shaming comments slide anymore.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Lizzo</strong></a> has been vocal about trying to help people accept all body sizes.</p><p>“I want to normalize my body. And not just be like, ‘Ooh, look at this cool movement. Being fat <a href=#>is body-positive</a>.’ No, being fat is normal,” the “Truth Hurts” singer told <a href=#>Vogue</a> in October 2020. “I think now, I owe it to the people who started this to not just stop here. We have to make people uncomfortable again, so that we can continue to change.”</p><p>Of course, it isn’t just being over a certain weight that draws criticism. If the trolls don’t claim a celeb is too fat, they might just reverse course and call them too skinny.</p><p>Good Morning America meteorologist <a href=#><strong>Ginger Zee</strong></a> has been open <a href=#>about her struggles</a> with anorexia and body dysmorphia, but that didn’t stop a Twitter user from claiming that “Hollywood” was “putting pressure” on the weather expert to lose weight in July 2021.</p><p>“Hmmm I rarely get called skinny (athletic more often) — have a BMI of around 21 — I would think this is about right for me 🙂 I’ve weighed the same (barring pregnancy) for almost two decades. Definitely not Hollywood,” she responded in July 2021.</p><p>Model <a href=#><strong>Iskra Lawrence</strong></a> is an outspoken advocate for body positivity, and she opened up to Us Weekly about her journey to self-love.</p><p>After spending many years “consumed with trying to fit one ideal … I really had to go on a journey of self-discovery,” she said in January 2019. “It’s all in your mindset. For me, it’s realizing that my body is my home so there can’t be anything wrong with [it]. It’s mine and it was made in this way. Just got to be grateful for it, and so other people can get in that mirror and find things that you can love and value and appreciate yourself.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Ashley Graham</strong></a> is another voice for body positivity in the fashion industry. “I wish that [loving yourself] was as easy as saying, ‘Here’s a magic pill,’” she told Us in June 2019. Instead, she said, “It’s just like doing homework. You have to put in the effort. So if I want to put in the effort, my effort will be I wake up every morning and I talk to my body.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Of course, when online trolls — or anyone, for that matter — have something negative to say about someone’s physique, it can be hard to maintain that level of positivity. But when faced with bullies and naysayers, the celebs below didn’t let mean comments get them down. Instead, they stood up for themselves with clever <a href=#>clapbacks</a>.</p><p>Scroll through the gallery to see how inspiring stars such as <a href=#><strong>Demi Lovato</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a>, <strong><a href=#>Kesha</a></strong>, <a href=#><strong>Bebe</strong> <strong>Rexha</strong></a> and more have shut down body-shamers and reminded Us that everybody should love the body they’ve got!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58sbXCrayrnaNkr6auxGapnrCYlnqttcuiZKudmaO1or7TZqSoqpViwLWt0axknKSRpXqjrcKkZJqsXZe8pcWMrJ%2BapZWnwHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
