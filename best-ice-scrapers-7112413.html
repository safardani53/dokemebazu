But when it’s time to emerge from the coziness indoors, digging your vehicle out from under that heavy white blanket is anything but wonderful — especially when your ice scraper isn’t exactly up to the task.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Road safety is at stake when you don’t fully clean off your car after a winter storm. There’s a good chance snow or ice can slide off while you’re driving and block your visibility or even worse — a layer of ice can fly off your car and cause damage or even injury to other cars and drivers. In fact, it’s the law in some states to clean off ice and snow before you hit the road. So if you’ve been relying solely on your defroster and windshield wipers, it’s time to get yourself a new ice scraper.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“My biggest recommendation is to look for [an ice scraper] with a longer handle,” says Richard Reina, product training director at CARiD.com, a leader in the aftermarket auto parts industry. “With the majority of people in the United States driving SUVs and pickup trucks, you really want something that gives you some reach.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While our PEOPLE Tested team can’t control the weather forecast in your area, we can help you out with recommendations for ice scrapers that will get you and your car through the winter. We tried out over 20 different ice scrapers to see which were the best options out there.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading to see our findings on the best ice scrapers of 2024.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-moyidea-36-inch-extendable-ice-scraper-snow-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Moyidea Extendable Ice Scraper Snow Brush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Moyidea 36-Inch Extendable Ice Scraper Snow Brush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/TDOnKHn1ghxLiMTg4EW_LsHKQtY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/moyidea-36-extendable-ice-scraper-snow-brush-detachable-snow-removal-tool-ff70a2d64b4345e2a67229ee4e80faa1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This scraper just took just one pass to remove ice, and we were able to clear a layer of icy snow off the windshield and windows in just 10 minutes with the Moyidea — even in 20-degree weather and without the use of their car’s defroster. Therefore, it's no surprise that this snow brush/ice scraper combo made our pick for best overall.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We found the Moyidea sturdy and durable enough for chipping away at thicker ice — not something you can say for every plastic ice scraper we tested, and we especially liked the wide pivoting brush made from PVC bristles. The extendable handle made it easy to clear off snow, so you don’t have to worry about straining to reach the middle of your windshield or the roof. The 4-inch-wide ice scraper detaches if you need to get in close to remove ice.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The cushioned handle on the extendable pole offers a comfortable grip, though this ice scraper is so effective that you likely won’t need to do much work to clean off your car. Plus, it comes with a storage bag so you can stow in your car in between blizzards or store it in the off-season. One thing to note: Parts can pinch your fingers during assembly, so be cautious or wear gloves. Overall, it’s a good price (especially when on sale) and truly does get the job done.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $9.99 (orig. $29.99)</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Style: </strong>Broom with ice scraper | <strong>Size: </strong>‎17.17 x 4.88 x 2.64 inches | <strong>Features: </strong>360-degree pivoting head with extendable handle</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2423 data-sizes=750px alt="Moyidea 36-Inch Extendable Ice Scraper Snow Brush" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/LOjrI6lE_FO4JkA0YgbAei4BPbE=/fit-in/1500x2423/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-ice-scrapers-test-moyidea-36in-extendable-snow-brush-detachable-removal-tool-dera-burreson-02-eadc1839e36444ceafbb42d459a3ab36.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Dera Burreson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2591 data-sizes=750px alt="Moyidea 36-Inch Extendable Ice Scraper Snow Brush" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/20R_I5FTZjtgc1gZVt55Enbj5QE=/fit-in/1500x2591/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-ice-scrapers-test-moyidea-36in-extendable-snow-brush-detachable-removal-tool-dera-burreson-01-2580cb1d0aa44ed1803374e4df93ac4d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Dera Burreson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-oxgord-2-in-1-ice-scraper--snow-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>OxGord Ice Scraper & Snow Brush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon OxGord 2-in-1 Ice Scraper &amp;amp; Snow Brush " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/T41rUk-iRM_XUnplIbs8I6TBUkA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/oxgord-2-in-1-ice-scraper--snow-brush-cd72dd9a09bb4d52b5d9f02903892fd2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This is one of the more basic ice scrapers/snow brush combos on the test, but it’s effective, and that’s what matters. The length of this ice scraper is great — we were able to clear the middle of the windshield without any problems. We also liked how the brush was rather wide, so it covers a lot of surface area. The handle is also padded, so it offers a firm, comfortable grip.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This ice scraper is lightweight yet durable, so it’ll get you through this winter and then some.

The brush can rotate 270 degrees, and the handle retracts from 61.5 inches down to 27, so you can use this for just about any size car. We were able to clear off the front and back windows along with the roof of their vehicle in eight minutes with no help from the defroster. Most of the ice could be cleared off in one pass, though it didn’t take much extra effort to clear off thicker ice, as well.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">All in all, the ice scraper on this works great. It’s lightweight, so it was easy for us to get to the roof of the car without any hand cramping. Just take care when putting this ice scraper together — the pieces can pinch (and the manufacturer does recommend wearing gloves to assemble). The foam grip is great, too,&nbsp;so if you don’t have gloves on while cleaning off your car, you won’t have to touch the freezing-cold metal of the handle. There’s also a bag to store it in when not in use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $19.99 (orig. $27.99)</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Style: </strong>Brush | <strong>Size: </strong>‎16.73 x 6.97 x 3.27 inches<strong> </strong>|<strong> Features: </strong>Extendable handle</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-investment-subzero-60-inch-quick-lock-pivoting-head-snowbroom></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Investment</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>SubZero Quick Lock Pivoting Head Snowbroom</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="SubZero 60-Inch Quick Lock Pivoting Head Snowbroom, Squeegee and Ice Scraper" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/a1cQlA9DAnsWU6KFRtbcGTd8DrU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/SubZero-60-Inch-Quick-Lock-Pivoting-Head-Snowbroom-Squeegee-and-Ice-Scraper-15966f3bfec34cab998aa0f5d46524f4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s easy to grab just any old ice scraper that you see on sale, but good luck getting through a storm, let alone an entire winter, with said scraper. While it might seem odd to think of an ice scraper as an investment, we do think that the Hopkins SubZero is worth the price you pay for it even when full price. Yes, it's one of the more expensive ones on our list, but if you live in an area that sees a lot of snow and ice, it's money well spent.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This sturdy snow broom has an ice scraper and squeegee attached, and the head pivots so you can de-ice your car from various angles. The handle extends five feet and the head is extra wide, so it's perfect for SUVs and even RVs. This ice scraper is really effective at removing ice, and we liked the brush on the bottom, too. While working on a rather thick layer of ice on a car, we saw no visible damage to the blade after chipping away at the ice. However, weighing over a pound, it could be hard to maneuver for some if fully extended. Overall, though, we like that it's simple and easy to use.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $29.94 (orig. $40.48)</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Style: </strong>Broom with squeegee and scraper | <strong>Size: </strong>37.8 x 4.6 x 3.5 inches |<strong> Features: </strong>Pivoting head</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Tammy Gardini</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-reach-subzero-14038-38-crossover-super-duty-snowbroom-with-pivoting-head></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Reach</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>SubZero Crossover Super Duty Snowbroom</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="SubZero 38-Inch Crossover Super Duty Pivoting Head Snowbroom &amp;amp; Ice Scraper" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/o8x9EKF_BhDEMR-JBK7Q6_MESY0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/subzero-14038-38-crossover-super-duty-snowbroom-4431bbec58df444295d80c9db008cbcc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.2</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.2</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=-1><p>Wide brush with pivoting head</p></li><li readability=0><p>Long, cushioned handle and curved pole for better leverage</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We tried out this ice scraper on a snow- and ice-covered car that had been left in the driveway all night. The large brush and long handle made quick work of the snow. The ice did require a bit of effort, but it did get cleared without the help of the defroster.

The exterior of the glove is made from a waterproof fabric with soft fleece on the inside. The glove is attached firmly to the scraper, so it's likely to hold up over time, as well. Of course, this is only as effective as your arm is long. Still, for such an inexpensive tool, you can’t go wrong with keeping one in your car.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $7.73 (orig. $10.99)</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Style: </strong>Glove with ice scraper | <strong>Size: </strong>‎13.82 x 6.38 x 2.8 inches<strong> </strong>| <strong>Features: </strong>Attached quilted nylon glove</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Alyssa Kingham</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-before-buying-ice-scrapers></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider Before Buying Ice Scrapers</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Price</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The most expensive ice scraper on our list is the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Birdrock Home Snow MOOver 55-Inch Brush and Ice Scraper</a>, which was about $35 at the time of publish.

You can probably scoop up an ice scraper at a discount at your local home improvement or automotive store after the cold season — provided there’s any left, of course. You’ll likely have a better chance of shopping for them online, though again for the best prices, shop during the off-season when people are focused on purchases for warmer weather.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Tammy Gardini</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our PEOPLE Tested team tried out 21 ice scrapers during several bouts of wintry weather in different regions throughout the country.

And by the way, companies can never buy our recommendation: Their products must earn it, fair and square.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In short, PEOPLE Tested provides recommendations you can trust — every day, every purchase.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5KawLV5yJycZquTp66xsdGsZHBpYWeBcn8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
