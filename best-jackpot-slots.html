Below, we outline the different versions that await players at our recommended casinos:</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Local jackpots</h3><p>With this type of slot, the progressive jackpot is specific to just a single game. This is in contrast to some other games, where the money is pooled from multiple titles. As a result, the local jackpot is contributed to by fewer players, while there is also less competition for places.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Pooled jackpots</h3><p>With pooled jackpot slots, bets placed on different casino sites add to the total prize. As such, potentially millions of players can add to the jackpot. So, when you view the jackpot amount online, this will be the same as on other sites.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Fixed jackpots</h3><p>The most common type of jackpot slot is fixed. Here, players can win a set amount of money. The jackpot does not change, meaning that it will be the same today as it was yesterday. Fixed jackpot slots are available with the majority of online casinos in the UK.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Progressive jackpots</h3><p>Many players are attracted to progressive jackpot slots. This is because the maximum win fluctuates over time. So, the more bets are placed, the greater the jackpot will be. However, once the jackpot has been won, it resets to its original amount.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Multiple jackpot slots</h3><p>With such slots, there is more than one jackpot up for grabs. In some cases, you will need to trigger bonus rounds in order to be in with a chance of winning additional jackpots. Bonus wheels are one of the common methods used by developers.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/thesun-play-jackport-slot-games.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How do jackpot slots work?</h2><p>Jackpot slots are different to regular slots. In most cases, the jackpot is progressive. This means that every time a bet is placed by a player, the jackpot grows. As such, the jackpot is not fixed. Jackpots can be worth millions. However, the jackpot will return to its default amount following a win, before building again over time. It is possible that a jackpot can extend over a network, meaning that the amount available to win is the same with multiple casinos. As such, the jackpot could be won by someone playing on a different site than you.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Are jackpot slots rigged?</h2><p>No. As is the case with other <a href=#>software-based online casino games</a>, jackpot slots use a Random Number Generator (RNG) to determine the outcome of each spin. As such, you can place bets safe in the knowledge that you stand a fair chance of winning.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Are progressive jackpots and jackpot slots the same?</h2><p>No. With a progressive jackpot slot, a proportion of each bet goes towards the total jackpot. Meanwhile, when the jackpot is won, it reverts back to the original amount. Meanwhile, traditional jackpot slots just have a jackpot to be won, which will often be smaller in size.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Duelz Casino sign up offer</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/thesun-claim-your-duelz-bonus.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>¬£100 bonus + 100 free spins on Book of Dead</p><p>18+ new players only.

Examples include NetEnt, Yggdrasil, Microgaming, Playtech and Big Time Gaming. NetEnt has under 20 jackpot slots to its name, including Divine Fortune and Hall of Gods. Meanwhile, Playtech has 30+, including the Age of the Gods series.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Are jackpot slots loose slots?</h2><p>A loose slot is one that has a higher than average payout rate. As a result, it is important to recognise that jackpot slots are not loose. They come with a below average RTP in most cases. This means that players should not expect regular returns. However, a win could well be bigger than with traditional slots.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is a high stake required to qualify for winning on a jackpot slot?</h2><p>No. You can potentially win the jackpot from the smallest possible stake. Therefore, it is not worth adjusting your budget in order to boost your chances of winning the jackpot. Instead, stick to the same strategy and never chase losses.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Luckster sign up offer</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Luckster-Casino-Bonuses.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>100% up to ¬£200 + 100 spins</p><p>18+ | New depositing players only.

However, those who <a href=#>follow our expert tips</a> will give themselves the best possible chance of being successful:</p><li><strong>Play for free first - </strong>With the majority of jackpot slots, it is possible to find a demo mode. This version of the game involves no risk at all. However, it allows players to learn the rules before potentially betting for real money.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Bet enough to qualify - </strong>In order to be in with a chance of winning a jackpot, it may be that you need to bet at least a particular amount. If this does not suit your strategy, then consider a different type of casino game.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Be realistic - </strong>This is especially true when it comes to jackpot slots. Remember that your chances of winning the jackpot are slim. Keep this in mind when placing bets and be happy with smaller, more regular wins.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Stick to your budget</strong> - Before you get started, set a budget. Only ever bet what you can afford to lose and never chase your losses.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Utilise auto play</strong> - Be sure to check whether an auto play feature is available with your chosen jackpot slot. When offered, this will save you from selecting the ‚ÄúSPIN‚Äù button each time you wish to place a bet.&nbsp;</li><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">About the author</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>James Fuller</p><p>James is an experienced copywriter with over a decade‚Äôs worth of experience in the iGaming industry.
