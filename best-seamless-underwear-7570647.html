As much as we want to just buy a value pack of whatever undies and call it a day, being intentional about underwear shopping can actually make a difference in overall comfort, support, and function. This is especially true when shopping with a specific need in mind, such as the best underwear that doesn’t show lines — a.k.a. seamless underwear.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Seamless underwear is a type of underwear made with no bands or elastics and is meant to stay in place with no visible seams or stitching,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Dr. Somi Javaid</a>, MD, FACOG, founder and Chief Medical Officer of HerMD tells PEOPLE. This type of underwear tends to be a little more forgiving and is less restrictive and binding and is a go-to option for those looking to eliminate the look of visible panty lines, no matter what underwear style they choose.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That being said, seamless underwear isn’t actually seamless, since underwear construction requires the use of seams to create shape and comfort. “When people say ‘seamless underwear,’ they are referring to underwear that minimizes the number of seams and eliminates the seams that are visible under clothing,” explains <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Noa Arias</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Shaula Yemini</a>, the co-founders of women's lingerie brand Bloomers Intimates.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Since nearly every underwear brand carries its own version of seamless undies, how do you know which seamless undies are actually worth it? With the help of experts, we researched dozens of seamless underwear options across all of the style categories to find the best high-quality options for comfort, fabric, support, style, and fit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading to learn more about our top picks for the best seamless underwear.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-eby-high-waisted-thong></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>EBY High Waisted Thong</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="EBY High Waisted Thong" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/qdgUEH3184WF5l__ry_AQqSq2Jw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/EBY-High-Waisted-Thong-dc097f7aa622498aacbf2cc863db8d02.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>EBY</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>These are a great pick for anyone who wants underwear that feels supportive but goes undetected under jeans, leggings, and other tight-fitting garments.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Eby High-Waisted Thong, our best overall pick, is one of the most comfortable pairs of underwear we own. We love the high-waisted style because it acts as a shield between our skin and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>high-waisted jeans</a>, providing longer-lasting comfort for all-day wear.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, the high-rise band feels ultra-supportive on the belly area and provides a light smoothing effect, making it a good option for those looking for underwear with some slight shapewear effects. While it’s not the most budget-friendly option on our list, we feel that the price tag reflects its high quality and durability. If you are looking for a good deal, the brand has a subscription option which reduces the price per pair. These may not be the best choice if you want underwear that comes in a wider range of skin tone options.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>XS-4XL | <strong>Color Options: </strong>Fallen rock, black, castle wall, nude, dusty rose | <strong>Material: </strong>Nylon, spandex, cotton | <strong>Features: </strong>Extra-wide side band</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-old-navy-soft-knit-no-show-hipster-underwear-for-women-3-pack></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Old Navy No-Show Hipster Underwear 3-Pack</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/I3Mf0laESnK1RF-hhBnVhDdbU_8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Old-Navy-Soft-Knit-No-Show-Hipster-Underwear-for-Women-3-Pack-8498ebe5fa944560a445100803219dc0.jpg"> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re shopping for a budget-friendly seamless underwear option, we recommend the Old Navy Soft-Knit No-Show Hipster Underwear, which comes in a three-pack (if you're looking to purchase only one pair, you may want to consider another option). These low-rise hipster undies are constructed from a breathable and stretchy nylon spandex blend with a comfortable cotton gusset.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love them for the completely seamless design and laser-cut raw edges that are invisible under clothing and stretch that hugs the body for a comfortable fit. The seamless hipsters also come in an inclusive size range and several skin tone colors, plus a pink, white, and black bundle if you want to switch it up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>XS-4XL | <strong>Color Options: </strong>Black jack, maple wood, cocoa mocha, dark walnut, frappe, pink | <strong>Material: </strong>Spandex, nylon, cotton lining | <strong>Features: </strong>Tag-free label, laser-cut edges&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-at-amazon-voenxe-seamless-thongs></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best at Amazon</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Voenxe Seamless Thongs</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon voenxe Seamless Thongs" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/5YHpWe8awhYVChM8uDWMk1u4FnM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/voenxe-Seamless-Thongs-0cced44667fa4862a09ef8669dd6fa5d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re shopping for underwear on Amazon and looking for versatile thongs, we recommend the Voenxe Seamless Women Underwear Thongs, which come in a pack of five for a great price. Constructed from stretchy and breathable fabric, these thongs stretch comfortably around the body without digging into the sides and go undetected under tight garments, including the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>best leggings</a> and bodycon dresses. With five stars from over 48,000 Amazon customers, the seamless underwear comes highly recommended for its comfort, breathable fabric, and fit.&nbsp;If you prefer a variety of underwear styles beyond thongs, you may want to check out some of our other seamless underwear options.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>XS-2XL | <strong>Color Options: </strong>Floral, pattern, basic, black, leopard print, apricot, bright color, white | <strong>Material: </strong>Polyamide, elastane | <strong>Features:</strong> Soft-bonded microfiber</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cooling-uniqlo-airism-ultra-seamless-high-rise-brief></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Cooling</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Uniqlo Seamless High-Rise Brief</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Uniqlo AIRism Ultra Seamless High-Rise Brief" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/_Jg253Z29cp4V091mIiz2atvVAQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Uniqlo-AIRism-Ultra-Seamless-High-Rise-Brief-e0fc6f02110f4206bc20f6e21032819b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Uniqlo</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The best underwear for summer weather — or if you live in year-round hot and humid climates — is the breathable Uniqlo AIRism Ultra Seamless High-Rise Brief, which is one of our favorites for wearing under <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>flowy dresses</a> and skirts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These high-waisted briefs are constructed from Uniqlo’s Airism fabric, which uses textile technology to wick away moisture and emit heat from the body for a more cooling sensation. They’re also super stretchy and have a buttery soft texture that feels amazing against the skin.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're more of a fan of mid to low-rise briefs, you may not like these high-rise briefs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>XS-2XL | <strong>Color Options: </strong>White, black, pink, rose pink, light pink, red, beige, light brown, latte brown, dark brown, aqua blue, periwinkle, dark blue, purple | <strong>Material: </strong>Nylon, spandex, cotton | <strong>Features: </strong>AIRism technology&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-value-amazon-essentials-womens-seamless-bonded-stretch-hipster-underwear></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Value</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Amazon Essentials Stretch Hipster Underwear</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/kGlA1gRCi5eOZiQ5Z8lo8fq3wU4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Amazon-Essentials-Womens-Seamless-Bonded-Stretch-Hipster-Underwear-fdd0e6988cd84466b9e6d8a4b479f3ca.jpg"> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Amazon Essentials Women’s Seamless Bonded Stretch Hipster Underwear is also worth considering, especially for those shopping with value in mind.

With thousands of positive reviews on Amazon, customers love these undies not only because they’re a good deal — they’re also made to last and keep their shape after many washes, too.&nbsp;If you prefer a different style, these hipsters might not be the ideal underwear choice for you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>XS-2XL | <strong>Color Options: </strong>Black, blue/pink, cool colors, earth tones, neutral tones, pale blue, warm tones | <strong>Material: </strong>Nylon, elastane | <strong>Features: </strong>Four-way stretch</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-brief-shapermint-truekind-seamless-stretch-mid-waist-brief></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Brief</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Shapermint Seamless Stretch Mid-Waist Brief</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Shapermint Truekind Seamless Stretch Mid-Waist Brief" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/-O95zSqzdPaugBz4lz_Ib-hWuvo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/shapermint-truekind-seamless-stretch-mid-waist-brief-9b42f7f786db489ca523eb3403d5fdcf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shapermint</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love the Shapermint Truekind Seamless Stretch Mid-Waist Brief for its ultra-comfy high-rise fit, breathable and stretchy nylon material, and flexibility. These undies also have a full-coverage design and feature laser-cut seamless edges to prevent visible panty lines, so they work really well under tight-fitting clothes, including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>yoga pants</a> and bike shorts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The fabric is also lightweight and thin enough to feel like a second skin while also providing enough coverage to remain functional and serve its purpose.

Instead, it has minimal seams — especially in areas that could cause visible panty lines like the leg holes. “When shopping for a seamless product, look for fewer seams, 360-degree stretch, and a lightweight, soft fabrication,” says Parks. She adds that the panty gusset and crotch panel require a moderate degree of construction, so it’s normal to see a lot more seams in this area. And, in some cases, seamless underwear might feature a discreet waistband.<br></p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How do you wash seamless underwear?</span></p><p>Since seamless underwear typically consists of more delicate fabrication, Parks says it should be washed with care. “The knit structure makes the product more prone to picks and snags,” she explains, noting that because of this, seamless underwear should be washed separately from garments with Velcro or zippers.&nbsp;<br></p><p>When washing seamless underwear, it’s best to launder based on the manufacturer’s care instructions for best results.
