There's the length to consider (Will I need to get these tailored?) to the wash (Do I *really* need another pair of dark wash denim?" — and of course, the fit (Does this flatter my body shape?).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One such style of jeans that has withstood the test of time is the straight leg jean. According to Cassandra Sethi, personal stylist and founder of Next Level Wardrobe, straight leg jeans are one of those styles that'll always have a place in a wardrobe, no matter what's cycling in and out of fashion at the time.&nbsp; "They're functional in the winter since they keep your legs warm, yet remain versatile and flattering on everyone no matter the season," she says. We know how accomplishing it feels to finally land on the right pair of straight leg jeans, so we put our research hats on to find the best options on the market.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With so many styles to choose from, here are the best straight leg jeans to add to your cart.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-gap-low-rise-stride-jeans-with-washwell></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Gap Low Rise Stride Jeans with Washwell</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Gap Low Rise Stride Jeans with Washwell" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/JAV14AWuc1phk8VtiCXP8MLR0mo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/gap-low-rise-stride-jeans-with-washwell--4730469eba0a40e68d88414f5c139e9b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Gap</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The sheer number of size and length options available for the Gap's Low Rise Stride Jeans with Washwell is impressive. Whether you're regular, tall, or petite, you'll definitely find your match. Even though these jeans are 100% cotton and don't offer much stretch, they boast a relaxed, loose fit that doesn't sacrifice comfort. Plus, if you're not into the whole high-waisted jean trend, you'll appreciate this pair's nod to the 90s with the classic low rise. Style these jeans with a graphic tee and some sneakers for a lived-in look, or go for a skin-tight bodysuit to add some balance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>100% cotton<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size Range: </strong>24-35 Regular, 27-33 Tall, 24-30 Petite<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>1<strong> </strong>| <strong>Inseam: </strong>Short, Regular, Long<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-good-american-power-stretch-pull-on-straight-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Good American Power Stretch Pull-On Straight Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=" Good American Power Stretch Pull-On Straight Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/6sCwYcLYLkLh8SVCOVs9CAtta_E=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/good-american-power-stretch-pull-on-straight-jeans-49f95426af174911b6925846f8d3e71c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Good American</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It'll be love at first try-on with the Good American Power Stretch Pull-On Straight Jeans. With two washes and nine sizes to choose from, these are the perfect pair of jeans to own if you're constantly in between sizes thanks to how forgiving the material is. During testing, we found these jeans to be incredibly comfortable and stretchy, to the point where it felt like we were wearing leggings the minute we put them on. We appreciate how smoothing and sculpting they are — we didn't experience any bunching with this pair, and we found the slim fit from the top to the knees to be very flattering.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>81.5% cotton, 5% recycled cotton, 4.5% elasterell-P, 5% recycled polyester, 4% elastane<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size Range: </strong>XS-5XL<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>2<strong> </strong>| <strong>Inseam: </strong>27.5 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-distressed-american-eagle-ae-ripped-highest-waist-baggy-straight-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Distressed</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>American Eagle AE Ripped Highest Waist Baggy Straight Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="American Eagle AE Ripped Highest Waist Baggy Straight Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Mi52caGhfzErvSSyr-4jG64HcOs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/American-Eagle-AE-Ripped-Highest-Waist-Baggy-Straight-Jean-11ffb4366d2f4ed086fa22e7f13b6435.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>American Eagle</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">So, you want to follow the ripped denim trend but don't want to commit. Cue the American Eagle AE Ripped Highest Waist Baggy Straight Jean: which will only set you back $60 and gives you the ultimate, effortless distressed look to really bring the cool factor. We're big fans of the comfort stretch waistband, which feels breathable and never restrictive. Plus, there are three lengths to choose from (short, regular, long) to fit all height brackets.

The ever-so-slight stovepipe style is a little more fitted from the waist to the knee, then features a more straight design as it tapers down, making it ideal for those with a long torso. When it comes to caring for this pair, you have options: either wash by hand or throw them in the freezer (yes, really) overnight. How's that for low-maintenance?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>98% cotton, 2% polyurethane<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size Range: </strong>23-32<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>5<strong> </strong>| <strong>Inseam: </strong>33 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-high-waisted-levis-70s-high-rise-slim-straight-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best High-Waisted</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Levi's 70's High Rise Slim Straight Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Levi's 70's High Rise Slim Straight Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/96ERkRIhjwKh1WC0RsXeasJ_Apg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Levis-70s-High-Rise-Slim-Straight-Jeans-a6defd6b46c64c8ba0cc7d227e5a908e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Levi's</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're looking for a modern take on the classic ‘70s denim style, look to this pair from Levi's, which feature the brand's signature “Sculpt with Hypersoft” fabrication. This technology ensures the jeans' super-soft, smoothing feel and structure (you'll never know they're 100 percent cotton with how comfortable they are). And, they're surprisingly durable for the low price tag, plus. This style is available in multiple shades to take your looks to the next level — but buyer beware, as the sizing tends to be inconsistent across washes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>100% cotton<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size Range: </strong>23-34<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>3<strong> </strong>| <strong>Inseam: </strong>31 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-waistband-agolde-criss-cross-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Waistband</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Agolde Criss Cross Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Revolve Agolde Criss Cross Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/3VOk8m_Pre-ZHOlRzgQ8zr3-5eM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Agolde-Criss-Cross-Jeans-c1c94407986d4200b6093468c2eac39d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Revolve</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>Due to its unconventional style, this look may not be desirable for shoppers on the hunt for a classic, straight leg jean.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Gone are the days when we would focus on making our bodies work with our jeans — now, we make them work for us. And this unique pair of denim is doing just that with a figure-shaping V-waist, which is the result of overlapped front panels, to create the look of a more sculpted midsection. Aside from the uneven waistband, these jeans fall into a nearly straight silhouette from thigh to hemline, and its faded, acid-wash fabric adds a little extra texture to this already-standout pair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>100% cotton | <strong>Size Range: </strong>23-34<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>1<strong> </strong>| <strong>Inseam: </strong>29.5 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-90s-style-abercrombie--fitch-ultra-high-rise-90s-straight-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best '90s Style</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Abercrombie & Fitch Ultra High Rise 90s Straight Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch Ultra High Rise 90s Straight Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/VRnEhY-TqyFLYAb4CsK_QpYLHLU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/abercrombie-fitch-ultra-high-rise-90s-straight-jean-7cad4070ec914c92ac0ed10e2d7cf875.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Abercrombie & Fitch</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With a fit this good, you'll want one of Abercrombie & Fitch's Ultra High Rise 90s Straight Jeans in every color (and you're in luck, because there's 16 of them to choose from). But don't worry, the under-$100 price tag won't break the bank even if you buy multiples (unlike its higher-end counterparts that steer way north of $100). Finding your fit is foolproof because there are several sizes and lengths to sift between, making them great for those who fall in the petite, tall, or plus sizes. Beyond this, we love the juxtaposition of the straight leg silhouette with the vintage ‘90s fit — the hem is also so subtly frayed that it won't overpower your look. One note: the fabric is a bit on the stiff side, so they're not ideal for sitting or doing any constrictive movement for long periods of time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>99% cotton, 1% elastane<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size Range: </strong>23W-37W<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>16<strong> </strong>| <strong>Inseam: </strong>Extra short, short, regular, long, extra long</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-celeb-worn-abrand-94-high-slim-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Celeb-Worn</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Abrand 94 High Slim Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Abrand 94 High Slim Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/tUsX4sTnHaV3Db9ewIMQdp6FoAs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Abrand-94-High-Slim-Jeans-f55313a3ea9e412f9661fbbac561caae.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Abrand</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though these high-waisted jeans may not look familiar to you right off the bat, according to a press release, they were the very pair that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Margot Robbie’s character in Barbie</a> sported during her final scene in the film.

Cue H&M's Mama Slim Ankle Jeans — not only will these not put a dent in your wallet, but they'll make you wish they made these in a non-maternity style. These fit like a glove but don't feel constricting, which is a combination that's hard to achieve when we're talking maternity jeans. That's all due to the wide jersey panel that's both breathable and adaptable to your growing belly. The ankle-grazing length is also noteworthy; they play nicely with any type of shoe from high-top sneakers to slip-on shoes (which we're willing to bet you're living in during pregnancy).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> 99% cotton, 1% spandex | <strong>Size Range: </strong>XS-XXL<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>1<strong> </strong>| <strong>Inseam: </strong>Not listed</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-nydj-high-straight-jeans-in-plus-size></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Plus Size</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>NYDJ High Straight Jeans In Plus Size</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="NYDJ High Straight Jeans In Plus Size" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/c2GIQBTekv01rbUhWh57Os5-H9Q=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nydj-high-straight-jeans-in-plus-size-8c5e84d4275948bb88817b3b4e29a0ec.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>NYDJ&nbsp;</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"The perfect pair of jeans doesn't exist," said no one who's tried this pair from NYDJ. There's a lot to love about these jeans: they feature the brand's proprietary “Lift Tuck Technology” that's meant to hug and support your curves, but because they're made with a super stretchy fabric consisting of only 53 percent cotton, they'll never feel stiff or uncomfortable. They're also available in both plus and regular sizing — and the released hem has “cool-girl” written all over it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>53% cotton, 21% viscose, 15% modal, 9% polyester, 2% elastane<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size Range: </strong>14W-28W<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>3<strong> </strong>| <strong>Inseam: </strong>29 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-petite-river-island-petite-90s-straight-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Petite</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>River Island Petite 90s Straight Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="River Island Petite 90s Straight Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/QkbSYA9Js6EsoeTkJqaSxEzLxKM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/river-island-petite-90s-straight-jean-8256d23f82f448efbf0ccf6a8541e88d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>ASOS</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This pair of denim jeans boasts all the qualities you know and love from a regular straight-legged style, but they're crafted for petite frames to ensure nothing is off balance. The side slits near the ankle adds a unique twist to the classic straight leg style — plus, we dig the ‘90s flare with the light denim wash and relaxed fit. We recommend pairing these jeans with a crop top to really show off the lace-up back detail.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> 100% cotton<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size Range: </strong>0-12<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>1<strong> </strong>| <strong>Inseam: </strong>Not listed</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tall-mother-denim-the-maven-heel-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Tall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Mother Denim The Maven Heel Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Net-A-Porter Mother Denim The Maven Heel Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/mpmGRq6D1cZTweJBvyVFBST4gb8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Mother-Denim-The-Maven-Heel-Jean-0c3bc75f5e214b04a70a2b6de1773164.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Net-A-Porter</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're tall, it may feel like you've tried every jean out there to no avail — but the search ends with The Maven Heel Jean from Mother Denim. These jeans have a 34" inseam to accommodate longer lengths, plus a high waist to flatter a longer figure. Speaking of the waist, it's slightly cinched, which provides a nice balance to the wide silhouette and is great for those wanting a relaxed fit without going full-on flare. And, because this pair already has light fading and whiskering, they'll be naturally resistant to fading in the future, making the triple digit price tag worth the investment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>98% cotton, 2% elastane<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size Range: </strong>23-34<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>1<strong> </strong>| <strong>Inseam: </strong>34 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cropped-7-for-all-mankind-left-hand-high-waist-cropped-straight></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Cropped</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>7 For All Mankind Left Hand High Waist Cropped Straight</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="7 For All Mankind Left Hand High Waist Cropped Straight" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/VOFRYR5fpQomf-6d-nYBUsppre4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/7-for-all-mankind-left-hand-high-waist-cropped-straight-cda0a3b92f444b45af0cb7f6b14d9a6c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Saks Fifth Avenue</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These 7 For All Mankind straight legs feature all the elements of a good jean: a cropped cut for ultimate breathability, a high-waisted rise that elongates petite frames, and a unique gray wash that's a refreshing alternative to the blues we're used to seeing.

If you're into lighter washes, you'll find the bleached light blue color easy to style. Pair these jeans with some ankle boots and a lightweight sweater for brisk days, or throw on a white tee and sneakers for an easy breezy vibe. Another quality that gives these jeans major brownie points: They run true-to-size, which helps take the guesswork out of something as tedious as denim shopping.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>100% cotton<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size Range: </strong>23-32<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>1<strong> </strong>| <strong>Inseam: </strong>Not listed</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-two-tone-madewell-90s-straight-jean-shadow-panel-edition></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Two-Tone</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Madewell ‘90s Straight Jean Shadow Panel Edition</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Madewell &amp;acirc;90s Straight Jean Shadow Panel Edition" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/7QCDJNbRvqLU4I99G9MeUe0oNnU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Madewell-90s-Straight-Jean-Shadow-Panel-Edition-cc4bdb8f65c54f6fa9db5a6aa5b453f8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Madewell</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Jeans can get, well, monotonous to look at after some time. There’s only so many shades of denim we can sift though before they all start to blur, but the Madewell ‘90s Straight Jean, in all of its patchworked glory, will make you stop in your tracks after scrolling for what feels like an eternity. This regular, straight-leg silhouette is differentiated by two dark-wash panels stitched onto the upper thigh, contrasting the light wash fabric that constructs these jeans and changing this everyday style into something that makes more of a statement. It also features a few faux-pockets along the backside of the jeans to add an extra oomph to this already elevated pair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>100% cotton | <strong>Size Range: </strong>23-33<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Inseam: </strong>30 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-raw-hem-paige-ultra-high-rise-cindy></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Raw Hem</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Paige Ultra High Rise Cindy</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Zappos Paige Ultra High Rise Cindy" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/EBrdarOt4rvt20bQo2LeWj3nKVk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Paige-Ultra-High-Rise-Cindy-eff6e2841c5e40ee8aa278a918a5c61a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Zappos</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Paige always manages to make every pair feel custom, and the Ultra High Rise style is no exception.

"That said, we are seeing some straight-leg fits with longer inseams that hit the shoe for a slightly stacked look." Think the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Mother Denim The Maven Heel Jeans</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Khaite Straight Leg Jeans</a>, which have carefully-placed waistlines and hem lengths to stretch your stems for miles. But ultimately, the length of your jeans will depend on a few things — your personal style and functionality being the main factors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You should also consider the best length for your choice of footwear for ease of styling. "If you’re looking for everyday jeans, choose a length that will best suit an everyday sneaker," says Lenett. Aside from footwear, he recommends taking the season into consideration. "If you’re living in a wet climate, for instance, opt for a shorter length to ensure your jeans last for multiple seasons," he says.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Material</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Jeans are made out of cotton fibers, and many of today's styles are made with materials like lycra or spandex for some added stretch, notes Lenett. "A lot of people still associate stretch with loss of shape retention or lack of structure, but there’s been a lot of innovation in denim over the last decade — it’s now possible to have the look of ‘90s rigid denim while also having just enough stretch integrated for comfort," says Lenett. "For that person who seeks to avoid stretch altogether, rigid raw denims are the best alternative."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There's also sustainability to consider. Lenett notes that there’s a big focus on integrating recycled fibers in place of virgin synthetics. To take things a step further, some brands are integrating "performance fibers like COOLMAX® with antimicrobial and cooling properties so jeans can be worn day after day without washing," says Lenett.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Rise</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Choosing the right rise for your denim is all about your personal style and body type. Lenett explains that low-rise jeans, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Gap Low Rise Stride</a>, hit on the hips and sit below your natural waist while mid-rise jeans, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Pistola Bobbies</a>, sit midway between your hips and belly button. "Mid-rise jeans offer more coverage than a low-rise but can feel less constricting than a high-rise, which typically sits at or above the belly button, accentuating the waist and providing more of an hourglass silhouette," he says.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There's also ultra-high-rise denim to consider, which sits even higher than high-rise and closer to the lower ribs. Take the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Paige Ultra High Rise</a> jeans and their leg-lengthening silhouette, which sits a bit above the waistline for the ultimate elongated look. While each style works differently for various body types, Lenett says that high-rise jeans offer added support around the hips and stomach, making it a solid option if you’re looking for pants with a snug fit across the midsection.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-ed07b518-8a43-408b-8702-c2caf379d2ac></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=49.276934201012><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>​​What women's jeans are in style for 2023?</span></p><p>Straight-leg jeans are a huge hit for 2023, as it's a shift away from skinny jeans and a throwback to ’90s trends, says Lenett. "It's the perfect blend between a classic, relaxed style that offers a vintage look but at the same time, a modern, flattering cut."</p><p>Besides straight-leg jeans, there are several women's jeans that are in style this year. For one, carpenter jeans are making their waves among fashion lovers, as they're a nod to the comfort of cargo pants we all know and love. "Many people [are] looking for a twist on their essential styles that are still functional, making this the perfect entryway for the cargo pant," says Sethi. "Look for a pair in a darker denim or olive color for maximum versatility."</p><p>A good pair of relaxed-fit jeans with a looser silhouette is also sought after this year. As Sethi notes, since the relaxed style can read casual, try pairing this type of denim with a more structured top to dress it up a bit (think: blazers, blouses, and sweaters).</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What shoes should I wear with straight-leg jeans?</span></p><p>Straight leg jeans are so versatile and can be worn for both casual outings and dressier occasions alike. "We’re seeing a lot of people pair a longer straight leg with a dressy boot for a more sophisticated look," says Lenett. "In terms of what to avoid, calf or knee-high boots that you’re hoping to show off won’t complement the straight-leg fit." If you prefer to go more casual, you can never go wrong pairing your straight leg jeans with a pair of everyday sneakers.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.96666666666667><p><span class=accordion__title>What are the most comfortable straight-leg jeans?</span></p><p>The most comfortable straight leg jeans are the ones that fit you the best. They should "be fitting throughout the leg, bottom, and waist," notes Sethi, and they should also pass the "sit test," which involves sitting down in your jeans and seeing if they dig into your stomach. If they do, you should go one size up. Also, pay attention to the type of closure the jeans have — while most will have a button and fly, some will have a button placket (a row of four or more buttons) or even a drawcord and elastic band, which Sethi says can be comfortable for those in the midst of a body transition. Some even come with a lace-up waistband (in back, no less), like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">River Island Petite ‘90s Straight Jean</a>.</p><p>Also, consider the material of the denim and if it'll have a break-in period. "Raw or non-stretch denim, typically made from 100 percent cotton, rely on starches that result in a stiff and rigid feel," says Lenett. "The 'break-in period' is critical for wearability and comfort." In any case, you’ll know you have the right fit if your straight-leg jean is snug (not tight) throughout the thigh and loose from the knee down, says Lenett.<br></p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-take-our-word-for-it></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Take Our Word For It</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Michelle Rostamian</a> has been covering beauty and fashion for the last 12 years, writing commerce roundups and service pieces on an array of topics.
