It's all in the art of the pour, but with the right decanter, you can fully enjoy older bottles and younger varieties like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Julianne Hough and Nina Dobrev's Fresh Vine Wine</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"Wines spend quite a while inside the bottle with no oxygen exposure," Master Sommelier Carlton McCoy Jr. tells PEOPLE. "Aeration expands all the dormant aromas and flavors in your wine by releasing accumulated gasses and softening the tannins." As one of the youngest Master Sommeliers to ever earn the title from the Court of Master Sommeliers and the second of only three Black Master Sommeliers in the world, McCoy offers a word of caution. "Keep in mind, too much oxygen can ruin a good wine. You must always limit the leftover's exposure to the air and keep it cool."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Bringing together a group of wine lovers, we tested 14 of the top wine decanters — decanting, aerating, and tasting wine all day (not all heroes wear capes). We sipped on the wine over the course of an hour, observing how the flavors changed, and comparing that to the wine poured directly from the bottle. After testing, we narrowed the list to five decanters that, through design, aeration, and overall performance, gave the wine a second life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Read on for the best wine decanters PEOPLE Tested.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-le-chateau-wine-decanter></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Le Chateau Wine Decanter</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Le Chateau Wine Decanter" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Y6nNjghn-3YbpUlAffvEI0VsonU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/le-chateau-wine-decanter-a035af3376cd4baf8d7b20737c88f2fe.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>This decanter has a slanted spout for easy pouring.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It has a classic design that holds up to a 750 ml bottle of wine.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It's made of 100 percent lead-free crystal.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It's backed by a lifetime warranty.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This is a simple and classic crystal wine decanter that comes assembled and is easy to use.

This 750 ml volume decanter performed well throughout testing, and after 45 minutes, its wine contents significantly opened up. The flavor was much more pronounced (bright red fruit) after decanting the wine and very little astringency was detected.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This is a class wine decanter model in both form and function, and we had a hard time finding a flaw. If we have to choose one, it drips slightly more than expected given the slanted spout, but it's still a minimal amount. It also proved easy to clean with a standard dish brush, making this a low-maintenance option as well. It's also backed by a lifetime warranty, which is a huge plus.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Volume: </strong>750 ml | <strong>Material:</strong> Crystal | <strong>Neck Size: </strong>Thick | <strong>Shape: </strong>Classic decanter | <strong>Dishwasher Safe: </strong>No | <strong>Extra Features: </strong>None</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-aerating-rabbit-pura-decanting-system></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Aerating</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rabbit Pura Decanting System</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Rabbit Pura Decanting System" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/4JsT0WOAiMvOEn6IwLBtw352KfQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Rabbit-Pura-Decanting-System-b47bd58d2fd640d79752086679075c11.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=-1><p>It aerates and filters using a special attachment to create a robust and flavorful glass of wine.</p></li><li readability=0><p>The decanted wine tasted much brighter and more flavorful than the one that was poured straight from the bottle.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The entire decanter — including the filter — is easy to rinse out in the sink.<br></p></li><li readability=-1><p>It catches sediment well via the filter.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Made by the same company that brought you the famous Rabbit wine opener, this unique decanter works two functions: aerating wine as you pour it in the decanter, and filtering as you pour it out into a glass. We noted that it pours with hardly any drips, but you have to pour from the bottle slowly due to the filter sitting on top of the decanter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After 45 minutes of decanting, we found the wine to be much brighter than the glass that was poured straight from the bottle, and it had some added complexity in flavors. The performance was evident by the delicious resulting glass of wine, but the design left something to be desired. It looks a little like a science beaker. It makes for a nice display when pouring the wine as the liquid comes out of narrow slots. However, the filter stays in the bottle and ultimately takes away from the sleek design.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While a standard cleaning brush doesn't fit into the decanter, it's easy to rinse out in the sink. The filter attachment is really easy to clean — all you need to do is rinse it and make sure you get the rubber stopper because that's what catches all the wine. We think this is an effective decanter that catches sediment seamlessly and helps wine open up so you can experience its best flavors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Volume: </strong>900 ml | <strong>Material: </strong>Glass | <strong>Neck Size:</strong> Thick | <strong>Shape: </strong>Beaker | <strong>Dishwasher Safe: </strong>No | <strong>Extra Features: </strong>Special filter for aerating and filtering the wine</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-investment-vspin-wine-aerator></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Investment</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>vSpin Wine Aerator</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="vSpin / Spiegelau Active Wine Decanter - Hand Assembled 100% Lead-free German Crystal &amp;acirc; Electric Wine Aerator set &amp;acirc; Original Patented Decanting Carafe &amp;acirc; Elegant Wine Gift Luxury Wine accessories" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/mi4p8K3aEiuKCZh11zVl--w_p4M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/vspin--spiegelau-active-wine-decanter---hand-assembled-100-lead-free-german-crystal--electric-wine-aerator-set--original-patented-decanting-carafe--elegant-wine-gift-luxury-wine-accessories-26e7dfcef1084a7399b4957714e35800.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>This decanter provides immediate aeration in under five minutes.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It brings out bold flavors and provides entertainment for onlookers.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It's easy to use and works with just the press of a button.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Wine is fully decanted within 15 minutes.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Perfect for a party, this spinning wine aerator is an attraction of entertainment. This device spins the decanter to create instant aeration, churning the wine into a vortex while pulling in fresh air. We thought it was entertaining and loved that you just pour and press a button once the spinner component is in place. The spinner auto sets at five minutes but you can change the time manually as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We noticed a difference in flavor right away; it definitely opened up with more juicy fruit after the five-minute spin. And after another spin, we tasted even more bright fruit. After 15 more minutes of straight decanting, it got even better with some additional complexity. The lead-free German crystal decanter is sleek in design, with the spinner device being a nondescript black plastic. You do need to charge it ahead of time or plug it in during use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only gripe centered on cleaning. Cleaning this one was a process because you had to remove the magnet spinner with a retrieval tool, wash the glass decanter with soap and water, and let it air dry. Given the tech involved, we understand why the price is a bit higher than other models, but we think the cost is worth the value in this case.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Volume: </strong>Not listed | <strong>Material: </strong>Lead-free German crystal | <strong>Neck Size:</strong> Thick | <strong>Shape:</strong> Beaker | <strong>Dishwasher Safe: </strong>No | <strong>Extra Features:</strong> Spinner used to decant the wine in under five minutes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-decanter-set-btt-decanter-with-stand></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Decanter Set</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>BTäT Decanter with Stand</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="BTaT- XL Decanter with Drying Stand, Stopper, Brush and Beads, Hand Blown Crystal Glass, Wine Decanter, Wine Carafe, Wine Accessories, Red Wine Decanter, Wine Gift" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/gzCXxltYFsL3NK38WBJFHtccNhI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/btat--xl-decanter-with-drying-stand-stopper-brush-and-beads-hand-blown-crystal-glass-wine-decanter-wine-carafe-wine-accessories-red-wine-decanter-wine-gift-00a3ce4c2b034bdebd317f027a561561.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=2><li readability=4><p>It comes fully assembled with everything you'll need to decant wine, including a drying stand, cork stopper, cleaning brush, and beads.</p></li><li readability=0><p>The wine flavor peaked at around 30 minutes with rich, complex taste notes.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a decanter that comes with all the necessary accessories, consider adding this set to your wine bar to go with your selection of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>quality wine glasses</a>. As the decanter comes fully assembled, all you have to do is pour the bottle of wine in.

The set comes with a brush and stainless steel cleaning beads, as well as a handy drying stand for easy maintenance. The drying rack is really easy to use and is sturdy enough to keep the delicate glass upside down without falling.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In terms of performance, this decanter worked its magic. The flavor peaked at 30 minutes, and after that the brightness faded and the wine became less complex. Considering all the gadgets that come with this set and its competitive price compared to other decanters, we think this decanter is a solid value.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Volume:</strong> 1800 ml | <strong>Material:</strong> Hand-blown lead-free crystal glass | <strong>Neck Size: </strong>Thick | <strong>Shape:</strong> Classic decanter | <strong>Dishwasher Safe: </strong>No | <strong>Extra Features: </strong>Comes with a stopper, drying stand, stainless steel cleaning beads, and brush</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-before-buying-a-wine-decanter></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider Before Buying a Wine Decanter</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Neck Size</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One thing you should consider is the neck size of the decanter you want. A wide neck works best for aeration since it allows more oxygen to reach the wine — not to mention they're easier to clean. The <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">vSpin Wine Aerator,</a> our pick for the best investment wine decanter, has a wide neck. A thin-neck decanter doesn't allow for as much aeration, but it does filter out sediment better when pouring the wine into a glass from the decanter. Thin necks are also somewhat tricky to clean, so you'll need special cleaning beads for that process.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Volume</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Many decanters are designed to hold (at minimum) a 750 ml or standard-sized bottle of wine. That's the most practical size for regular use, but different sizes can come in handy for special occasions. For instance, if you're having a party or large gathering, you might want a decanter that holds more than one bottle. Our pick for the best decanter set, the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">BTaT Decanter with Stand</a>, holds 1800 ml, more than two bottles of wine. Conversely, if your household doesn't regularly finish a bottle in one sitting and you want to decant just a glass or two at a time, there are smaller decanters for that purpose.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Ease of Cleaning</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While cleaning is the least fun part of decanting wine, it can't go without consideration because if you don't clean the decanter well, residual soap can affect the flavor of future wine you pour. Most decanters are hand-wash only — if you can find a dishwasher-safe one, bonus points! — so you'll want to look for a shape that fits a brush easily or be prepared to buy extra cleaning gadgets such as a decanter brush, cleaning beads, and drying stand to remove any moisture after.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Best Wines for Decanting</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Generally, wine decanters are brought out to let older wines breathe (like that old bottle you've been saving for a rainy day!). They help remove sediment that has collected at the bottom of vintage bottles and allow them to open up to boost the flavor profile. However, as McCoy says, "You can justify decanting almost any wine. At times I will decant champagne if I feel that the aggressive effervescence is interfering with the complex base wine. Generally, though red wines benefit most from decanting. They tend to hold the most sediment."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Technique for Decanting</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The exact technique will depend on the decanter you buy, but generally, there is a standard method to pour wine into a decanter. "The wine should be poured in a gentle consistent stream so as to not disturb any deposits in the bottle. Younger wines will need more time to decant than older more delicate wines," says McCoy, adding that "you can also agitate the wine by shaking the decanter vigorously."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>People / Fred Hardy</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested-wine-decanters></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested Wine Decanters</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Using 750 ml bottles of a 2020 California Red Blend to decant, we (a group of wine enthusiasts) tested 14 of the best wine decanters for use, design, performance, ease of cleaning, and overall value.

We considered the volume of the wine decanter and the spout design. For aeration, some decanters simply require a single pour from the bottle, but others have a more involved process. We observed the aeration process for each wine decanter, as well as the ease of pouring a glass of wine once aerated.</li><li><strong>Tasting: </strong>The most anticipated part of the test — the taste! — came next. After letting the wine breathe, we took sips every 15 minutes over an hour to see how well the wine opened up and tasted. Comparing the flavor of a glass poured directly from the bottle to that of a decanted glass, we determined if the aerated glass had truly opened up so we could taste each rich note of fruit, spice, and earthy goodness.</li><li><strong>Cleanup:</strong> Finally, we cleaned the wine decanters to judge how simple or difficult the process was.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-72ea1adc-d5a7-4e5d-a650-f5a153d48433></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=49.892307692308><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What is the purpose of a wine decanter?</span></p><p>Decanting wine allows the wine to breathe, which is particularly important for red wines.
