They returned to the US in 1976 when she was 20 and were married. By that year, Bo had been given a makeover and was rechristened Bo Derek. She caught the eye of <strong>Michael Anderson</strong>, who cast her in the 1997 horror movie, Orca. Bo’s iconic role came in 1979, when she starred in the romantic comedy, 10. Bo’s appearance in a flesh-colored swimsuit and cornrow hairstyle became an iconic scene in movie history. She followed it up with appearances in A Change of Seasons and Tarzan, the Ape Man.
