He is the best lawyer in Hanyang (modern-day Seoul). Kang Han-soo, who is knowledgeable and skilled at manipulation, is both admired and envied by many. Initially driven purely by vengeance and deception, the lawyer gradually transforms into a voice of the people and a hero.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Woo-Do-hwan-1.jpg alt="Woo Do-hwan" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>All About Joseon Lawyer</h2><p>Joseon Lawyer is based on the Gyeongguk Daejeon, a code of law from the late Goryeo and early Joseon Dynasties, the tale and characters are entirely fictitious.
