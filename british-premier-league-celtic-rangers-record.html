which will receive backing from the UK Government, Fifa and Uefa - will also see a post-season play-off format introduced.</p><p>Much like in rugby and American sports, the final standings after what would become a 34-game season would <strong>NOT</strong> see a champion crowned.</p><p>First would play fourth and second play third, with the winner of each clash competing in a championship game.</p><p>Despite all the changes, the biggest for most is finally seeing the two giants of Scottish football joining forces with England's elite.</p><p>There were discussions during the 1990s and 2000s about Celtic and Rangers joining the Premier League, with the two having dominated the Scottish top-flight for nearly 40 years now.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>FREE BETS: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GET OVER Â£2,000 IN SIGN UP OFFERS HERE</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/RF-BSL-GRAPHIC-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/9d1abd0a-cd99-4d0f-948a-fc3fc0e9fee3.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p>No other side has won the Scottish title since the 1984-85 Aberdeen squad managed by none other than Sir Alex Ferguson.</p><p>But now it's believed both Celtic and 2020-21 champions Rangers are willing to leave the glory behind to slug it out with England's giants, keen to see a spike in interest from fans across the world, sponsors and broadcasters.</p><p>How have the two clubs fared historically against English opponents?</p><p>In history, Celtic have played English clubs 20 times in competitive games, winning seven, drawing seven and losing six.</p><p>Rangers have played 14, winning just <strong>THREE</strong> while losing seven times.</p><p>Celtic average 1.4 points per game, with Rangers further back on just 0.9 -
