On May 4th, 2007, the 19-year-old woman was sexually assaulted and bludgeoned to death in her boyfriend's Texas home, and the investigation soon went cold.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Since May 4th, 2007, my whole life has changed ... I don't feel safe anywhere," McGlone's mother, Patricia Tice <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>previously told PEOPLE (the TV Show!).</a> "That my sweet 19-year-old daughter could be murdered the way she was in a small town, and that she was surrounded by monsters and people capable of murder — and that I had no idea."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">McGlone's murder is still unsolved, and the case is the focus of tonight’s episode of&nbsp;People Magazine Investigates,&nbsp;titled "Dead in Bed."
