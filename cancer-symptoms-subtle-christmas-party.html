Feeling bloated</h2><p>Some level of <a href=#>bloating</a> around <a href=#>Christmas</a> is almost a given - we eat and drink a lot after all.</p><p>But an extra <a href=#>swollen tummy</a> or persistent <a href=#>bloating</a> could indicate there is something more serious going on.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health</h2></p><p>While it can be a sign of <a href=#>irritable bowel syndrome</a> or <a href=#>coeliac disease</a>, it is also one of the most common symptoms of <a href=#>ovarian</a>, <a href=#>stomach</a> and <a href=#>liver cancer</a>.</p><p>CRUK says: "It’s quite common to experience a bloated or swollen tummy that comes and goes from time to time.</p><p>"But if you feel bloated most days, even if it comes and goes, talk to your doctor."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Fluttering stomach</h2><p>Another red flag symptom is a sense of ‘fluttering’ beneath the ribs.</p><p>A 2014&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">British Medical Journal</a>&nbsp;report referred to patients experiencing ‘pain’ and ‘fluttering’ in their stomach ahead of a pancreatic cancer diagnosis.</p><p>Lisa Woodrow, pancreatic cancer specialist nurse at&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pancreatic Cancer UK</a>, says: "We don’t frequently hear people talk about a fluttering sensation in their abdomen, but this could be related to digestive issues caused by the pancreas not working properly."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Difficulty swallowing</h2><p>It might also be time to see a doctor if you notice you're finding it difficult to sip your <a href=#>prosecco</a> or munch on <a href=#>mince pies</a>.</p><p>This could present as pain or a burning sensation, or food may stick in your throat or chest.</p><p>"These are the most common symptoms of oesophageal cancer," CRUK says.</p><p>"Talk to your doctor if you are having difficulty swallowing and the problem doesn’t go away."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Gurgling insides</h2><p>Gurgling sounds coming from within aren't uncommon over the festive period, but it's another symptom to be on alert for.</p><p>Lisa Woodrow, who oversees hundreds of <a href=#>cancer</a> patients, says many experience the same sensation.</p><p>"I&nbsp;wonder often if this is due to malabsorption of food due to insufficient pancreatic enzymes, thus this is often wind and digestion related," she added.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. Changes in taste</h2><p>Food and drink can taste peculiar when you have some cancer treatments, but it can also be a symptom of advanced cancer.</p><p>This often presents as a metallic taste, and is most common in patients with <a href=#>head and neck cancer</a>.</p><p>Experts say people may also feel their sense of smell is altered, and how their mouth feels is different.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. Indigestion</h2><p>"It is normal to feel slight discomfort or pain sometimes after eating a large, fatty or spicy meal," CRUK says.</p><p>"But if you have heartburn or indigestion a lot, or if it is particularly painful, then you should see your doctor."</p><p><a href=#>Indigestion</a>, also known as <a href=#>heartburn</a> or acid reflux, is one of the symptoms of <a href=#>stomach and pancreatic cancer</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. Nausea</h2><p>Nausea (and sometimes vomiting) occurs in up to 70 per cent of people with cancer, <a href=# aria-label="research (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a> shows.</p><p>This can be due to certain chemicals, tumours blocking the digestive system, having a slow gut or too much calcium in the blood, for example.</p><p><a href=#>Brain tumours</a>, liver tumours, and GI tumours are more likely to cause nausea and vomiting, according to CancerNet.</p><p>However, it's reassuring to know that feeling a little sick is also common in cases of <a href=#>food poisoning</a>, <a href=#>norovirus</a> and <a href=#>vertigo</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8. Dizziness</h2><p>Feeling lightheaded every now and then is usually nothing to worry about.</p><p>So getting a little dizzy at your work Christmas do means there is likely no need to panic.</p><p>But if the sensation persists for more than a couple of days, you should speak to your GP.</p><p>While unlikely, dizziness and feeling off-balance can be a sign of blood cancer or a&nbsp;<a href=#>brain tumour</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9. Croaky voice</h2><p>Festive get-togethers involve speaking to a lot of people.</p><p>At work, it's non-stop chatter with your colleagues, while at home it might be playing loud games with the kids.</p><p>The addition of blaring Christmas <a href=#>music</a> also means you might need to shout - so it's only natural you might sound a little hoarse.</p><p>Having a croaky voice is common with <a href=#>colds</a> and viruses, but hoarseness that hasn't gone away should be checked out, CRUK says.</p><p>It could be a sign of&nbsp;<a href=#>laryngeal</a>, throat or <a href=#>lung cancer</a>, the charity adds.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>10. Loss of appetite</h2><p>Appetite loss can happen for many different reasons - from infections to <a href=#>depression</a>.</p><p>But if you notice you're not as hungry as usual - especially over Christmas - and it's not getting any better, speak to your doctor.</p><p>Ovarian, lung, stomach and pancreatic cancers can all make you want to eat less.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>11. Back pain</h2><p>Standing up for long periods at parties throughout December can make our legs and <a href=#>backs hurt</a>.</p><p>But unexplained or persistent&nbsp;<a href=#>aches and pains</a>&nbsp;can also be a sign of&nbsp;cancer.</p><p>The location of these could indicate the type - chest pain for lung cancer, for example - but it may also mean the disease has spread.</p><p>This is a sign you need a&nbsp;<a href=#>health</a>&nbsp;screening.</p><p>CRUK says: "Pain is one way our body tells us that something is wrong.</p><p>"As we get older, it’s more common to experience aches and pains.</p><p>"But unexplained or persistent pain anywhere in the body could be a sign of something more serious."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>12. Swelling</h2><p>The same goes for swelling.</p><p>"Persistent lumps or swelling in any part of your body should be taken seriously," CRUK says.</p><p>"This includes any lumps in the neck, armpit, stomach, groin, chest, breast, or testicle."</p><p>So if you notice any unusual lumps while squeezing into your Christmas party dress or suit, take note.</p><p>The build-up of fluid that causes swelling, known as <a href=#>lymphoedema</a>, occurs in cancer patients when the disease blocks a lymph node or vessels.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>13. Fatigue</h2><p>Finally, partygoers should be aware that fatigue can be a sign of cancer.</p><p>Doing any kind of&nbsp;<a href=#>physical activity</a>, including housework, <a href=#>decorating the Christmas tree</a> and festive nights out, can be a little tiring.</p><p>However, if you’re feeling tired for no clear reason, it could be a sign that something is wrong.</p><p><a href=#>Extreme fatigue</a> is a common symptom of <a href=#>blood cancers</a> like <a href=#>leukaemia</a>, <a href=#>lymphoma</a> and <a href=#>myeloma</a>, as well as <a href=#>breast</a>, <a href=#>bowel</a> and <a href=#>prostate cancer</a>.</p><p>CRUK estimates almost 65 per cent of people with cancer experience fatigue.</p><p>The charity says: "There are lots of reasons why you may feel more tired than usual, particularly if you’re going through a stressful event, or having trouble sleeping.</p><p>"But if you’re feeling tired all the time, or, for no clear reason, it could be a sign that something is wrong - speak to your doctor."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Cancer kills around 167,000 people in the UK every year.</p><p>The earlier the disease is caught, the better the chance of survival.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqGcmqSknXxzgJhvaG9uZWSworrCnqlmq6mivbW7zKxkrK2SqbmmecKhqaKrpKKutHnPmqmtsV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
