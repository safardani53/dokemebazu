Isn’t that cool? I don’t need it anymore.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Carly-Waddell-Plans-Give-Wedding-Ring-Daughter-Bella-After-Evan-Bass-Split-001-1.jpg><p>The Texas native added that she was also going to “save” some of her formal looks for the little one — including the purple dress she wore when Bass, 38, proposed.</p><p>“This one I wore when I got engaged,” the “Dream Train” singer said before showing Bella the floor-length gown. “Is it bad that I just, like, want her to not like this one? I actually got this in Aruba when I was working at a cruise ship. Lots of these are cruise ship clothes I took to Bachelor Land.”</p><p>Waddell’s daughter did approve of the dress because of its leaf pattern and purple color. She said, “One day, I’m gonna dress up like mama.”</p><p>The “Mommies Tell All” podcast cohost shares Bella and son Charlie, 14 months, with the <a href=#>Bachelorette</a> alum. News broke in December 2020 that the Bachelor Nation members had called it quits after three years of marriage.</p><p>“We went to therapy,” Waddell said at the time. “We focused a lot more on the kids than we focused on ourselves and, ultimately, I think that was our biggest downfall. … If you don’t have a foundation for yourself, then you crumble.”</p><p>The former cruise ship singer added, “I always told him, if he wanted out it was his call because I just am not a person that would ever be out. … What are you gonna do? If somebody doesn’t wanna be with you, they don’t wanna be with you and you sage.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Carly-Waddell-Plans-Give-Wedding-Ring-Daughter-Bella-After-Evan-Bass-Split-002.jpg><p>Waddell noted that she and the erectile dysfunction expert <a href=#>split in November 2020</a>, while Bass’ ex-wife, <strong>Marie Bass</strong>, alleged that the <a href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a> alums had been <a href=#>broken up for two years</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Amid their divorce, <a href=#>Waddell has hired a nanny</a>. “Bella says that that’s her best friend which makes me really happy, you guys,” she gushed in a YouTube video earlier this month. “Because I don’t think it could be any better than that. So shoutout Sam, you’re awesome.”</p><p><strong>Hear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!</strong><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGacmaKhxm7DwJ2bnqScYr2trc2sZK2nXZy2t7GMnZiun5ipsrN51p6bnaGenHqztc2gZJ%2Bqn6J6psLAp2SbmaOofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
