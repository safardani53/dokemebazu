Tennis superstar <strong>Caroline Wozniacki</strong> is engaged to NBA player <strong>David Lee</strong>.</p><p>The 27-year-old Danish athlete announced the exciting news on Friday, November 3, in a post to her Instagram, which shows her giant new diamond ring&nbsp;– an 8.88 carat&nbsp;oval stunner from Hamra Diamonds.

One follower wrote: “Omg congratulations! That ring is pretty insane 😉 nice job 👌🏻👏🏻 so happy for you!” “STUNNING! Congratulations to you and @dlee042 and happy planning,” added another.</p><p>The 34-year-old basketball player also took to his Instagram to share a gorgeous photo of him and his beaming bride-to-be. “She said YES! So thrilled to be engaged to my soulmate! ❤️💍,” he added.</p><p>Wozniacki was formerly linked to NFL star <strong>J.J. Watt</strong> and prior to that, it was her high-profile split from golf pro&nbsp;<strong>Rory</strong> <strong>McIlroy </strong>that garnered attention after he famously broke off their engagement in May 2014 over the phone. While McIlroy claimed that their split was “mutual and amicable,” Wozniacki later revealed that it was just as much as a shock to her as it was to fans.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I thought, at least, I would get a face-to-face or something, but there was nothing,” she said during an interview on In Depth with Graham Bensinger in September 2014. “It was just a phone call and then I did not hear from him again.”</p><p>Wozniacki recently won the BNP Paribas WTA Finals in Singapore in October, beating <strong>Venus Williams</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmaKkuaq6xGauqLKenq6kt8hmmKecXZmut7XDZqOenV2Wv6Z5xKeemp%2BVmXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
