(opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>Claim the Duelz welcome bonus and start playing!</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to get the best casino sign up welcome bonuses</h2><p>The vast majority of online casinos available in the UK now feature a sign-up or welcome offer. However, there are several steps that customers must take to qualify. The following is a step-by-step guide that explains how you can get your hands on a bonus as a new player:</p><li>Enter your chosen casino site on desktop or <a href=# aria-label="mobile (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">mobile</a>.</li><li>Select the “Register” or “Join Now” button.</li><li>Complete the registration page by entering the required personal details.</li><li>Opt-in where necessary and enter a valid bonus code if any are available.</li><li>Confirm your account and verify it via the link found inside your welcome email.</li><li>Login to your new account using your username and password.</li><li>Access the “Deposit” page and select an eligible payment method.</li><li>Add funds to your account, ensuring that you meet the minimum deposit amount.</li><li>Once your deposit has been processed, you will likely receive your bonus within 24 hours.</li><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What makes a good casino welcome bonus for UK players?</h2><p>It’s easy to get dazzled by a casino bonus that offers huge sums of money and an enormous pile of free spins, but things aren’t always as they seem. Instead of simply going for the biggest bonus you can find, you should <strong>opt instead for the one that offers the best value</strong> in terms of a staking requirement. Here’s what makes a great casino bonus:</p><ul><li><strong>Realistic wagering requirements</strong>&nbsp;- Bonus cash is always burdened by wagering requirements. These dictate how many times the amount needs to be turned over (churned) before it becomes real, withdrawable cash. As a general rule,&nbsp;<strong>a wagering requirement over 50x is virtually impossible to meet</strong> and require a significant lucky streak. Welcome bonuses that come with 35x wagering or less are considered to be the fairest in the industry.</li><li><strong>Quality game allowances</strong>&nbsp;- More often than not, your bonus cash and/or free spins can’t be used site-wide. Instead, the terms and conditions will list specific games your spins can be played on, or exclude particular game titles.<strong>&nbsp;If the games have low RTP then your chances of hitting winning spins are significantly diminished.</strong>&nbsp;Check out the games you’re allowed to play on, and make sure they’re well known titles from quality providers.</li><li><strong>Fair game weighting and bet size</strong>&nbsp;- Not all games contribute equally to wagering requirements.&nbsp;<strong>Slots usually contribute at 100%, but table games generally stand at about 10%.&nbsp;</strong>Weighting percentages are always buried in the fine print, so take a look and make sure the weighting fits your playing style. Check out the bet size cap too. If you’re limited to 2p spins then you’re unlikely to ever get anything great out of the bonus.</li><li><strong>Generous timeframes</strong>&nbsp;- Once you activate your casino bonus, you need to get to work turning it over to meet wagering requirements.<strong>&nbsp;There’s always a time limit attached, but the expiration date will vary from bonus to bonus</strong>. Shore timeframes make it impossible for recreational players to succeed. That’s why you should be looking for bonuses with an expiry of about 30 days.</li></ul><p>For example, a 100% bonus up to £100 with 30x wagering and 30 days expiry is far better than 300% up to £1,000 with 70x wagering and 14 days expiry. <a href=# aria-label="One such bonus is the Winomania casino bonus (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">One such bonus is the Winomania casino bonus</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are the best casino welcome bonuses & sign up offers?</h2><p>As I already explained, there’s no set formula for a casino welcome bonus. It can come in multiple formats. However, British players seem to prefer a generous combination of&nbsp;<strong>bonus cash and free spins</strong>, so this is the most common offer on the market. But these offers can come with different rules and triggers. Here are the different types of bonuses you’ll come across:</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Deposit bonuses</h3><p>A deposit bonus is a way to raise the value of a deposit by bulking up the real cash deposit with bonus cash. It’s the online casino’s way of saying thank you for depositing at the site by giving you <strong>more to play with</strong>. For example, <strong>deposit £10 and get an extra £20 in bonus cash</strong>. They’re a fantastic way to expand your reach beyond your true budget. Of course, the additional bonus cash comes with wagering requirements.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Extra spins bonuses</h3><p>An extra spins bonus is one that could come with free spins or without. These are usually staggered offers that allow players to complete checkpoints for an extra set of free spins.</p><p>For example, you could <strong>make a deposit of £10 or more to trigger 100 free spins</strong>, and then a further 50 extra spins on your second deposit. In truth, casinos can formulate these offers anyway they like, mixing bonus cash and loyalty points to make offers all the more tempting.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left">Free welcome bonus no deposit required</h3><p><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">No deposit casino bonuses</a> award new players the option to claim bonus cash or free spins (but usually free spins) before even making a single deposit on the site. The thing you should know about no deposit casino bonuses is that they’re usually much smaller than the welcome offer, and the wagering requirements are higher.</p><p>Even if your bonus translates into a win, you’ll eventually have to deposit anyway in order to play through the bonus win and turn it into cash.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Match bonuses</h3><p>A match bonus is literally when the&nbsp;<strong>casino matches your cash deposit with a second amount in bonus cash.</strong>&nbsp;These are usually calculated in percentages of 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%. For example, a 100% deposit match bonus means that if you deposit £30, you’ll get another £30 in bonus cash on top.</p><p>A 50% bonus means that if you deposit £30, you'll get another £15 in bonus cash on top. Your bonus amount comes with wagering requirements. These can be as low as 5x, but they usually come in at about 35x.</p><p>I don’t recommend accepting wagering requirements higher than this. Before claiming a bonus, check whether there are any other withdrawal restrictions in place.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Biggest advantages of casino bonuses</h2><p>Choosing a good and honest casino bonus will allow you to:</p><p><strong>Extend your budget</strong> - For recreational players with small deposit budgets, activating a casino bonus will give them double or more to play with. This allows players to spin and bet for longer, and get more out of the experience.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/biggest-advantages-of-casino-bonuses.jpg><p><strong>Try out new games</strong> - Having more to play with will allow you to try out a wider range of games. However, most bonus offers also come with free spins linked to particular games you might not have heard of. With the huge range of slots on offer, it's tempting to just stick to what you know, but a bonus could take you out of your comfort zone.</p><p><strong>Increase your winning chances</strong> - Everyone knows that the trick to winning big on slots is hitting the bonus round. Higher paying slots come with higher volatility, which means the wins are bigger but they’re slower to hit. If you have more money to spin, then your chances of hitting a super rewarding bonus round are greatly increased.</p><p>Depending on the operator you can use the bonus money to play more of your favorite casino slots, such as <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starburst</a>, Aliya's Wishes, Big Bass Bonanza, <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Immortal Romance</a>, Arena of Gold, <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sweet Alchemy</a>, or many others that are eligible. Pay attention to game contributions, deposit types, card restrictions, app restrictions, spin winnings, withdrawal terms, and other bonus terms, before making your pick from the best casino bonus sites.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, pay attention to mobile responsiveness and whether the casino has a dedicated app if you plan to play on the go.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">Claim the Grosvenor Casinos welcome offer and start playing on the app.</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Things to look out for in a casino welcome bonus</h2><p>Every bonus offer, welcome or otherwise, comes with a list of terms and conditions. Much as they’re not fun to read, it’s essential that you know exactly what you’re signing up for. Here are some of the key points to take note of before accepting a bonus or any other kind of deposit offer:</p><ul><li><strong>Time limits</strong> - Your bonus will always come with an expiry date. You need to complete wagering within the time specified or the bonus will be cancelled and you’ll lose out on any wins generated with the bonus cash. Ideally, 14 to 30 days are required to give you enough time.</li><li><strong>Wagering requirements</strong> - Rollover requirements are a necessary evil of almost every bonus offer. The key is to make sure they’re fair and achievable. Ideally your wagering requirements are limited to 35x, with a 50x wager being the absolute highest you should accept.</li><li><strong>Wagering contribution table</strong> - Knowing the game weighting or wagering contributions is key to successfully turning over your bonus. As a general rule, slot games contribute at 100%, table games contribute at 10% and all other games at 0% - but this can vary from site to site. Also take note of games that are excluded from your wagering contribution.</li><li><strong>Match percentage</strong> - This one can be a little tricky to work out. Most welcome offers keep it simple with a 100% match percentage. That means you get the full amount you deposited once again in bonus cash. So if you deposit £20 you get another £20. However, deposit match bonuses could also be set at other amounts like 50% and 25%. With a 50% deposit match, if you deposit £20, you’ll get £10 in bonus cash.</li><li><strong>Maximum bets and winning caps</strong> - Most casino bonuses come with limits. These limits cover how high you can set your bets, as well as the maximum amount you can win. These two factors are key indicators to determine the value of the bonus. If your win is capped too low, then it’s not worth the trouble of trying to meet wagering requirements. And if your max bet is also low, it could make it too hard to achieve big enough wins to churn the bonus.</li><li><strong>Limited games</strong> - The games you’re permitted to play with your bonus can mean the difference between success and failure. Older slots tend to pay out in very low amounts, and if your bonus can only be used on lower quality games then it’s probably not worth your time. Look out for bonuses that come on flashy, big name games to really ramp up your chances of success.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/The-Sun-How-to-claim-welcome-bonus-1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to cash out a casino sign up offer</h2><p>I'm not going to lie to you - turning your bonus cash into real cash will require an element of luck. But players get lucky all the time and it’s very common to successfully profit from the right welcome bonus.</p><li><strong>Activate the bonus with your first deposit </strong>- this usually comes in an opt-in format, or requires you to check a box confirming your choice.</li><li><strong>Use your bonus to play eligible games</strong> - these are generally slot games, but read the terms to find out exactly which games contribute to your bonus wagering.</li><li><strong>Meet the wagering requirements</strong>&nbsp; - turn your bonus over the states a number of times to turn it into real cash.</li><li><strong>Track your progress</strong> -&nbsp; on most sites, you’ll find a tracking bar in your account section which tells you how far you’ve come.</li><li><strong>Withdraw your win</strong> - Once you’ve met the wagering requirements, your remaining profit can be withdrawn as real cash from the cashier section.</li><p>I chose this bonus as my favourite because of its very fair 30 x wagering requirements on bonus cash. Wagering requirements are only boosted to 45 x on winnings from the bonus free spins. All you have to do is make a deposit of £20 or more in order to activate the offer, and you’ll be able to place bets up to a maximum of £2. Your maximum bonus win is capped at a very generous £500.</p><p>Keep in mind that if a casino also has a sports betting section, you might be eligible for either bonus bets in the sportsbook section, or the casino bonus and free spin promotion. After spending your game bouns, keep your eye out for reload bonuses and check if the casino has a VIP program.&nbsp;How long does it take to see my casino sign up bonus in my account?</p><p>Assuming that nothing went wrong, once you opt in to your welcome bonus and make a deposit, the bonus will appear instantly in your account. What’s important to note here is that<strong> at this stage, the bonus cash isn’t eligible for withdrawal</strong>. You’ll need to wager the bonus cash for the stipulated wagering requirements before you can cash out. The good news is that you’ll be able to get started on meeting those wagering requirements almost instantly.

In general, players can expect to find the following terms for every bonus:</p><ul><li>Expiry date</li><li>Wagering requirements</li><li>Restricted games</li><li>Wagering contribution</li><li>Maximum bets and winning caps</li><li>Accepted payment methods</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Frequently asked questions about casino welcome bonuses</h2><p>While welcome prizes at casinos for new depositors (or non-depositors!) seem pretty straightforward, there are some things players should know before claiming any bonus package.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Why do online casinos give away welcome bonuses?</h3><p>As nice as the thought might be, online casinos don’t give away bonuses for the goodness of their hearts. While players can certainly benefit from big bonuses if they’re smart about which ones they choose, online casinos also benefit in the long run. Here are the main reasons why an online casino gives out the welcome offer and other bonuses to players:</p><ul><li>To encourage players to make their first deposit by boosting their budget for free</li><li>To compete with other online casinos in a very saturated space</li><li>To give players the opportunity to explore more of the site’s games</li><li>To give players a reason to log in a second time and engender loyalty with rewards</li><li>To encourage longer sessions which in turn usually results in multiple deposits&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Since online casinos have a great variety of games like live dealer versions of <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">poker</a>, <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">baccarat</a>, <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">roulette</a>, and <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">blackjack</a>, in addition to bingo, keno, lottery, video slots, card games, and exclusive games, deposit offers come in handy.</p><p>People have the opportunity to test the variety of games.&nbsp;Just keep in mind that some games have a better stake contribution than others. These player restrictions may change your mind if you wanted to opt-in at some casino sites.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Can I get casino bonuses even if I’m not a new player?</h3><p>You absolutely can. While you can only ever claim a welcome bonus once, the majority of good quality online casinos have a ‘promotions’ section loaded with other offers and bonuses.</p><p>These are in place purposely to <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">keep players engaged</a> with the site long after any benefits from the welcome package have dried up. These bonuses are usually a combination of free spins, deposit match offers, network promotions, cashback, and much more. As with all promos, it’s very important that you take a couple minutes to read the terms for each before making your choice.</p><p>The things to look out for are <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">minimum deposits</a>, maximum win cap, wagering requirements, time limits, and game restrictions.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Can I win real money with a welcome bonus?</h3><p>Welcome bonuses are designed to help players land bigger wins then they could with just a basic deposit. The catch is that there’s a decent chance you won’t win at all.</p><p>This shouldn’t come as a surprise, as casino gambling games never offer a guarantee of success. But with a little planning, skill and a decent dose of luck, you could see yourself withdrawing a real cash win thanks to a well-appointed welcome bonus. All you need to do is play games and place bets using your deposit and bonus cash.</p><p>Each time you win you contribute to wagering requirements. The trick is to continue your upswing until wagering is met, without running your funds down to zero.</p><p><strong><a href=# aria-label="Win some cash with the 10bet casino welcome bonus! (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Win some cash with the 10bet casino welcome bonus!</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Are there fees for casino welcome bonuses and offers?</h3><p>Not really. Casino bonuses come as an added benefit to your regular deposit. However, you can consider the actual deposit made by the player in cash as a fee. Every bonus (unless it’s a no-deposit bonus) comes with a minimum deposit requirement.</p><p>So if you usually only deposit £10 and the bonus requires £20 to be activated, you can consider that additional £10 as an activation fee of sorts. The plus side is that the funds are yours to use as you please, and are never lost to the casino.</p><p>The short answer is that so long as you choose a quality bonus, it’s a free roll route to potentially much larger wins and jackpot payouts than you would manage with your regular deposits.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. What payment methods can I use to claim a casino welcome bonus offer?</h3><p>A depositor might not be able to use just any payment method to claim a casino bonus. Most first-time deposit casino bonus offers are eligible for:</p><ul><li>Visa</li><li>Prepaid cards</li><li>PayPal</li><li>Skrill</li><li>Neteller</li></ul><p>If you're not sure about eligibility for your 1st dep, customer support will always have up-to-date information for you.&nbsp;A rare few casinos will allow you to also claim their welcome bonus with the following payment methods:</p><ul><li>paysafecard</li><li>Trustly</li><li>Apple Pay</li><li>Google Pay</li><li>Boku</li></ul><p>Online casinos will also have a minimum deposit amount that you have to provide before you can claim the bonus or claim games' bonus winnings.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">About the author</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/James-Fuller-2.jpeg><p class=article__content--intro>James Fuller</p><p>James is an experienced copywriter with over a decade’s worth of experience in the casino industry.
