Well, guess what? I’m one of them n—as!” Brown, 27, said in a now deleted clip posted to his Instagram story. “If I love you, bitch, ain’t nobody gonna have you. I’m gonna make you miserable.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/chris-brown-ddb43b8a-908d-4eda-b21e-efed7e69bca8.jpg><p>He added: “I’m going to chase that n—a out and I’m gonna chase yo ass around, and it’s done.”</p><p>Fans took to Twitter to sound off on the Grammy winner’s questionable remarks. “Chris Brown admitting he’s that crazy stalker ex boyfriend on his instagram story like … we already know,” one fan wrote, while another tweeted: “chris brown is such a taurus lmao, his instagram story got me dead.”</p><p>However, some were more harsh on Brown and brought up his past — and at-times volatile — relationships with former girlfriends <b>Karrueche Tran</b> and <b>Rihanna</b>.</p><p>“This man needs help. Nothing cute about this behavior,” one concerned follower wrote. Another pointed out that the R&B crooner’s sentiments sound “like the intro to an episode of <i>Dateline.</i>”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/chris-brown-instagram-video-33628132-439d-4732-9709-f9e244ce2204.jpg><p>Brown’s rant about his love life comes nearly a month after <a href=#>he and <b>Soulja Boy</b> started feuding over 28-year-old Tran</a>, whom the “Loyal” singer split from in 2015 after years of on-and-off dating.</p><p>The fight ignited after the “Crank That” rapper, 26, liked a photo of Tran on Instagram. “Chris brown just called me and said he wanna fight me because I liked @karrueche picture on Instagram this n—a a bitch,” Soulja Boy wrote on Twitter on January 2.</p><p>“Aye @chrisbrown pull up n—a I’ll knock yo Bitch Ass out,” he continued. “F–k @chrisbrown. That n—a @chrisbrown better not tweet s–t with his p–sy ass. He called my phone trippin so now I’m trippin F–k n—a. Fruits!”</p><p>Soulja Boy then brought up Brown’s rocky romance with ex RiRi, 28,as well as his previous legal trouble. “Chris Brown think he hard cuz he hit a woman,” the hip-hop star tweeted. “And jumped a fan at his house party on New Years lmao u can’t fight Bitch do that s–t to me.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>Brown responded via Instagram with a series of videos and memes making fun of his new enemy. In one, Brown mentioned his 2-year-old daughter, Royalty, saying, “Happy New Year! Royalty is 2 and has 5 times more money than Soulja Boy already. I’d be mad too.”</p><p>Though a date and venue have yet to be announced, the two men plan to fight each other in the near future during a public boxing match. Brown is training with<b> Mike Tyson</b> while Soulja Boy has enlisted the help of Tyson’s No. 1 rival <b>Evander Holyfield</b>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoKKewG6u0aiup2Wnlr%2Bvv4ylpq%2Bdoqh6tbTArWShnaNirm6%2F05qjpJ2iYravecOiqq2tope2r7OMr6CdnZ9ixHWCk2xqbGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
