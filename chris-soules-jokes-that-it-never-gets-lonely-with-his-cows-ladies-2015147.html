Bachelor <strong>Chris Soules</strong> joked about his singlehood in a new Instagram update on Monday, July 13, revealing that he's surrounded by good company <a href=#>following his high-profile split</a> from <strong>Whitney Bischoff </strong>in May.</p><p>"Never gets lonely around here," Soules, 33, cracked, alongside a picture of himself on a farm littered with cows. "…I can come home to these ladies and their little ones! #cowappreciationday #homegrown."</p><p><strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a> </strong>confirmed on May 28 that Soules and his fiancee Bischoff, who edged out finalist <strong>Becca Tilley</strong> in Season 19 of The Bachelor, had broken off their engagement, nearly two months after the finale aired. "Whitney Bischoff and Chris Soules have mutually and amicably decided to end their engagement," the couple told Us in a joint statement at the time. "They part with nothing but respect and admiration for one another and will continue to be supportive friends. They wish to thank everyone who has supported them through this journey."</p><p>Following their split, Bischoff returned to her native Chicago, while Soules stayed on his family's farm in Arlington, Iowa.</p><p>In the subsequent weeks, the Dancing With the Stars alum has been focused on family and farm life. The hunky farmer celebrated Independence Day with his nieces on Lake Michigan, sharing a pic of them at the beach. "Per her request, turning my niece into a sand mermaid… With help from friends," the proud uncle wrote last week, alongside a snap of his buried niece.</p><p>This past weekend, he posted another photo of himself supporting his nephew. "At my nephew Brogan's playoff baseball game. They won big!" he wrote. "So proud watching him rip a line drive into left field for an RBI and a double base hit! #prouduncle."</p><p>Soules also reunited with other fellow DWTS alum for a foundation supporting local schools. "Reunited and it feels so good!" he captioned a pic with Alfonso Ribeiro and his wife Angela. "Especially when we're out here in God's country supporting #Iowa schools through the #zachjohnsonfoundation and #kidsoncourse."</p><p>In moments of solitude, Soules has shared several stunning images of life on his family's property. "Dad, the crew, and I getting the sprayer ready for tomorrow morning. Gotta get it done before the rain comes down! #farmlife," he wrote last week, alongside a sunset shot, followed by a sunrise photo.</p><p>"Sun is coming time to get after it!" he captioned the gorgeous image of acres upon acres of lush green fields.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoKKewG6%2Fzq6jnqtdn7yssdJmq6GZpGK2tXnNnq2eql2csrW%2FjKWmp52crnq4tdOhZKGho2KwsMPSZqOanJmawG5%2Bj2psamxnZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
