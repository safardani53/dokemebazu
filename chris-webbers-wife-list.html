People born in the year of the ox are dedicated workers who take their responsibilities seriously. Even if they encounter difficulties at work, they will continue. They aren't very romantic, but they are patient and would never impose themselves on someone they didn't like. They are normally silent and keep their emotions hidden. Others find it difficult to understand them. When they lose their cool, it's like an explosion that scares people away.</p><p>People born on March 1 have a zodiac sign of <strong>Pisces</strong>.

Pisces is the zodiac's most perceptive, sensitive, and empathic sign, and that's because it's the last of the last. Pisces, as the final sign, has absorbed every lesson taught by the preceding signs, including the pleasures and sorrows, hopes and anxieties. It is represented as two fish swimming in opposite directions, symbolizing Pisces' continual divide of attention between imagination and reality.</p><p>Former University of Michigan star and leader of the infamous Fab Five.
