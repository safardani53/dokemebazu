The same can be said for the caliber of individuals in their legions.</p><p>The Parisians currently have one of the most star-studded squads in the world, have been the clear winner of the 2021 summer transfer window. PSG, who already had highly valuable players, took it a step further by signing the El Clasico captains in a matter of weeks. Sergio Ramos and Lionel Messi both arrived on free transfers.</p><p>While we’re still unsure about who the best player in PSG’s ranks is, let’s take a look at their most successful players in terms of trophy haul.</p><p>Top five current PSG players with the most career trophies</p><h2>#5 Sergio Ramos — 25</h2><p>Ramos has yet to play for PSG due to an injury.<br>To the surprise of many Real Madrid fans, PSG secured the transfer of Sergio Ramos. The signing of the former Spanish captain as a free agent was a steal for the nine-time Ligue 1 champions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ramos.jpg><p><strong>Sergio Ramos</strong> has had a stellar career thus far and now appears poised to dominate the French league. However, due to an injury, the former Real Madrid center-back has yet to play for PSG.</p><p>Sergio Ramos is one of the most decorated players in the history of Spain and Real Madrid, and he has always been at the forefront of big moments. He is the only captain in modern Champions League history to have won three consecutive UEFA Champions League titles.</p><p>Sergio Ramos’ 25 career trophies include a FIFA World Cup, two EURO Cups, and four UEFA Champions League titles.</p><p>The Spanish central defender has agreed to a two-year contract extension until June 30, 2023.</p><h2>#4 Marco Verratti — 28</h2><p><strong>Marco Verratti</strong> is widely regarded as one of the most dedicated and talented midfielders of the modern era. Verratti’s diminutive stature makes him swift, and when combined with his creativity, this becomes lethal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Marco-Verratti.jpg><p>Since joining PSG in 2012, the Italian midfielder has appeared in over 350 games across all competitions. Verratti has had a significant impact on each of his club’s achievements.</p><p>Marco Verratti currently has 28 career trophies in his trophy cabinet. It also includes Italy’s Euro 2020 victory. The player from Pescara has won the Trophée des Champions eight times in a row. He has also won the Coupe de la Ligue twice a row.</p><p>Despite a plethora of career trophies, Marco Verratti has yet to win a continental trophy with the club.</p><h2>#3 Marquinhos&nbsp; — 28</h2><p><strong>Marquinhos</strong> has begun his ninth season as a PSG player and his second as the club’s captain. Marquinhos has begun his ninth season as a PSG player and his second as the club’s captain. The 27-year-old has won 28 career trophies with Corinthians and PSG at club level and for Brazil at the international level.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/msa.jpg><p>The Brazilian defender is in his ninth season with PSG and his second as captain. Thiago Silva’s departure in 2020 was expected to put Marquinhos in leadership and defensive role challenges. However, the former Roma man has carried out his duties with dignity.</p><p>Marquinhos was a member of the Brazilian teams that won the Copa America in 2019 and the Olympic gold medal in 2016. Marquinhos, who was an integral part of Brazil’s Copa America 2021 campaign, narrowly missed adding another trophy to his collection.</p><p>In his eight years at the club, he has won six Ligue 1 titles.</p><h2>#2 Angel Di Maria — 28</h2><p><strong>Angel Di Maria,</strong> widely regarded as one of the best Argentine players of all time, has spent his entire career with a major club. Angel Di Maria’s career reached a pinnacle during his four years at Real Madrid. The Argentine winger gained widespread acclaim and was sought after by several European heavyweights.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Angel-Di-Maria.jpg><p>Angel Di Maria was forced to graze for new turf due to increased competition from Real Madrid’s record-breaking signing, Gareth Bale. Di Maria left Real Madrid for Manchester United in 2014, winning six trophies at the Santiago Bernabeu.</p><p>However, after a brief but disappointing spell at Old Trafford, the ex-SL Benfica forward moved to PSG in 2015. Maria rediscovered his lost form in the Parc des Princes.</p><p>Angel Di Maria, dropped several times last month, has put Argentina ahead!<br>He went on to win numerous trophies with his new team and is now one of the squad’s most valuable players.</p><h2>#1 Lionel Messi — 37 points</h2><p><strong>Lionel Messi</strong> holds every single club and individual record. As a result, it comes as no surprise that Lionel Messi is PSG’s most decorated player in terms of team honors. The former Barcelona player is also one with the most career titles in football history.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Lautaro-Martinez.jpg><p>During his time at Barcelona, the Argentine was phenomenal, winning every trophy a player could win. Messi, who is on par with his rival Cristiano Ronaldo in almost every aspect, filled the void left by the national team’s lack of a title this year.</p><p>Argentina’s Copa America victory in 2021 ended a 28-year trophy drought. Leo Messi has won <strong>10 La Liga</strong> titles and four UEFA Champions Leagues.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiarqqimru1ec%2Bsnmasn6V6dnnPpZiynaKoeri106FkpqejqXqkrdGenKtlpKe8sbTInqpo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
