She’s an amalgam of personality problems and <a href=#>it’s making her rich</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s not a surprise that these two are feuding. It’s just a surprise that it’s taken this long.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg></p><p>This feud between 15-year-old girls began when a grown adult woman decided to take to social media to post a lengthy rant about why one was better than the other.</p><p>"I’ve seen people make fun of this girl many times because ‘she’s acting too young,’" writes a woman named Nicole.</p><p>"I don’t know too much about her," the woman writes of JoJo. "But all three of my girls love her."</p><p>She’s 15 years old and a face of Nickelodeon," the post continues. "She also is a spokesperson for Michael’s Arts and Crafts store."</p><p>"There are GROWN WOMEN on some of her posts who are trashing her because of the way that she acts."</p><p>After decrying this, this grown woman then goes on to trash a different 15-year-old girl for the way that she acts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Nicole whines about Danielle Bregoli, who "has publicly disrespected her mother, danced half-naked on the internet, dressed like she’s grown, etc."</p><p>Many would point out that all of those activities are very age-appropriate for a high schooler.</p><p>"I would much rather have girls love JoJo," she writes. "Than ‘Bhad Bhabie.’"</p><p>The woman then writes a line that has only ever been used by bad people: "And people wonder why the kids these days act the way they do."</p><p>"People like JoJo are made fun of for being young while people like ‘catch me outside’ girl makes [sic] millions being a delinquent."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>In and of itself, that sounds like a woman who is trying to defend a teen girl against unwarranted trolling (while also making some mostly fair criticisms of another teen girl).</p><p>JoJo Siwa — or whoever runs her social media accounts — boosted this post, adding her own words:</p><p>"This post means so much to me," the JoJo Siwa tweet reads.</p><p>"Thank you Nicole for writing this! I love being a positive role model," she writes. "And I want everyone to know it’s ok to be a kid and to not worry about growing up so fast!"</p><p>The tweet concludes: "To everyone who supports me, I LOVE YOU!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Would you care to guess who didn’t particularly care for … any of this?</p><p>Danielle Bregoli herself quoted JoJo’s tweet, adding a few choice words of her own.</p><p>"Suck my dick," Danielle tweeted. That’s a fair and, frankly, age-appropriate response to seeing another girl your age boost a post dedicated to bashing you.</p><p>JoJo hadn’t said anything directly bad about Danielle at that point — she’d just promoted a post that did.</p><p>After Danielle’s tweet, that changed.</p><p>"Exactly my point," JoJo writes while quoting Danielle’s tweet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>We’ve definitely been hard on Danielle in the past, because, well, she did very much become famous because of her delinquent behavior.</p><p>But she’s turned unfortunate circumstances into a success story — and she’s still a literal child. That’s impressive.</p><p><a href=#>Danielle Bregoli is breaking records with her music</a>, and was nominated for&nbsp;2018 Billboard Music Award for Top Rap Female Artist earlier this year.</p><p>JoJo is also a success story, absolutely, but while it is never appropriate to harass her with comments about her appearance, we should be honest.</p><p>Danielle’s behavior — awful and occassionally criminal though it may be — is wildly more age-appropriate than JoJo’s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>JoJo’s look is clearly designed to appeal to a certain demographic — young children and their easily scandalized parents.</p><p>Danielle is appealing to people within her own age range, and it’s working. Part of that is because Danielle reads like an authentic teenager and not as a cartoonish caricature.</p><p>We’re sure that JoJo will one day be able to shed this look and live as herself. For now, she’s a minor and she’s making money by catering to kids. Whatever makes her happy.</p><p>But she should know that one can accept a compliment without agreeing with insults aimed at someone else.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>15 of the Craziest Celebrity Twitter Feuds EVER</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2WEcLDAp6CepJyaeqO%2BxKCmpaFdlrulecmooahlo57EonnFnqydZZ%2BjerXDyK2rnqpf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
