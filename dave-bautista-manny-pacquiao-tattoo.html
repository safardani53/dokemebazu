More on exactly why the <a href=# style=text-align:start>Glass Onion</a> star feels so passionately about getting inked in a moment. Recently, Dave has spoken out about having former friend <a href=# style=text-align:start>Manny Pacquiao</a>’s team logo removed from his arm.</p><p>The boxer made extremely anti-gay comments, which led Dave to not only cover up his <a href=#>tattoo inspired by</a> Manny, but to end his association with the now-politician for good. Here’s what we know about the emotional situation.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dave Bautista’s Manny Pacquiao tattoo is a part of his past and so is his former friend.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>As the <a href=#>Guardians of the Galaxy</a> alum shared in a now-viral <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a> for GQ, he changed up the ink on his arm for a very personal reason. Although Dave doesn’t mention Manny’s name specifically, he notes in the clip in part, "I was part of a team of a person I considered a friend and someone I really looked up to. And then, he later came out publicly with some anti-gay statements."</p><p>“So, I had a huge issue with it,” Dave continued, adding, “It's a personal issue with me. My mom's a lesbian. And I just could no longer call him a friend. So, I had it covered up with this.” The actor then reveals a sugar skull tattoo.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So what did Manny say that so deeply hurt Dave and so many other people?</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@gq href=#>@gq</a><p>Dave Bautista on why he got one of his coverup tattoos <a title=gq href=#>#GQ</a> <a title=tattootour href=#>#TattooTour</a> <a title=wwe href=#>#WWE</a> <a title=davebautista href=#>#DaveBautista</a> <a title=mcu href=#>#MCU</a> <a title=tattoos href=#>#Tattoos</a> <a title=bautista href=#>#Bautista</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - GQ - GQ" href=#>♬ original sound - GQ - GQ</a></figure><p>Fans can easily infer that Dave is talking about his relationship with Manny, whose <a href=#>anti-gay comments</a> made international headlines in 2016. As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a> reports, while running for a senate seat in his native Philippines, Manny was interviewed for a TV show, and said about gay people, “It’s common sense. Will you see any animals where male is to male and female is to female?”</p><p>“The animals are better,” he cringingly continued. “They know how to distinguish male from female. If we approve [of] male on male, female on female, then man is worse than animals.”</p><p>Although Manny later offered a public mea culpa via social media, he didn’t exactly walk back his comments, and said hurting people was wrong, but added, “this does not change my position against <a href=#>same sex marriage</a>. That’s what I believe. My only mistake is comparing gay people to animals.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dave, a huge tattoo lover, is not the only celebrity who has spoken out against Manny.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>"Through my tattoos, I tell the story of my life."

Hilariously, the ink was based on a photo of <a href=#>Peaky Blinders’ Cillian Murphy</a>, a fact that eagle-eyed fans quickly picked up on as soon as the tattoo was revealed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfma63sYybmK6smajBonnMmqWnsV2lrqS91KKYqGWklsG1u84%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
