However, there are some specific features and rules that you must understand before getting started. The main goal is to predict whether the amount of money in your briefcase is higher or lower than that of the banker. Deal or No Deal Live is broken down into different rounds, outlined below:</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Qualification round&nbsp;</h3><p>In the time given, players must spin a three-reel bank vault in a bid to align the gold sections on at the top of the wheel. You can select your stake and level of difficulty. You will also be given the option of purchasing one or two rings that are immediately aligned to the wheel. This increases the cost per spin by 3x or 9x respectively. Each spin also increases the amount of cash inside the most valuable briefcase by anywhere from 75x to 500x your bet.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Top Up Wheel</h3><p>The top-up wheel appears on your screen after the qualifying round. Here, players can increase their possible prize money by adding money to their briefcase by 5x-50x your bet. Select the top-up amount, before spinning the wheel. The more wagered, the higher the multipliers get.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Game Show Round</h3><p>You are now ready to dive into the Deal or No Deal Live studio. Here, 16 sealed briefcases are on display, each containing a different amount. The number inside briefcases, ranging from 1-16, represent the sum of money. Upon a set of briefcases being opened, the banker will call with an offer. This is the amount of money for you to exchange what is in your briefcase. Should you not make a decision before the time runs out, “No Deal” will be selected.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A closer look at the best casinos to play Deal or No Deal Live</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. <a aria-label="1.

As such, it can be tricky to decide which is best for you. When making your decision, be sure to consider the following factors in particular:</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Bonuses</h3><p>Part of the appeal of playing Deal or No Deal Live and other games online is the bonuses and promotions offered by casinos. It is likely that a welcome offer will be available. Meanwhile, ongoing promotions, <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">reload bonuses</a> and VIP rewards help to keep existing customers satisfied. Be sure to read the bonus T&Cs before signing up. Look into wagering requirements, eligible games and expiry in particular.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Games variety</h3><p>While Deal or No Deal Live is the focus of this page, it is nice to have other <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">casino games</a> to play. The best online casinos are home to hundreds, if not thousands, of slots. Meanwhile, a host of table, live dealer and instant win games are also likely to be found. So, ensure that your needs are met in this area before registering an account.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Terms and conditions</h3><p>Every online casino comes with its own unique terms and conditions. T&Cs will effect how you operate, including maximum payouts, gambling rules and account suspensions.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Payment speeds</h3><p>Generally, players will be able to choose between a range of different payment methods. These include debit cards, e-wallets, prepaid cards and bank transfers. Whichever option you select, ensure that both deposits and withdrawals are processed quickly and safely. It can take a number of days for you to get your hands on winnings from Deal or No Deal and other games.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Customer service</h3><p>Top online casinos will recognise the importance of offering support to their customers. Customer service is available via telephone, email and live chat in most cases. Meanwhile, an increasing number of casinos are also now active on social media. Casinos that offer 24/7 support will stand out in particular.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is the best Deal or No Deal strategy?</h2><p>A number of strategies are available to players betting on Deal or No Deal Live. There is no right or wrong choice. However, based on your budget and objectives, there will be systems that are better suited to you. Martingale, Fibonacci, D’Alembert and Paroli are among the most popular strategies, which use either progression of negative progression systems. For beginners, the Paroli strategy is the standout option. Meanwhile, high rollers may well favour Martingale. Be sure to have some system in place before placing your first bet.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Top tips for winning Deal or No Deal live</h2><p>As with any form of gambling, there is no guarantee that you will make a profit from Deal or No Deal Live. However, those who follow our expert tips below will maximise their chances of success:</p><li>Remember that in order to win the maximum payout, you will need to invest heavily in order to top up briefcases. Be sure to stick to your budget at all times.</li><li>You are only guaranteed a payout when you accept the banker’s offer. So, keep in mind that you could lose everything when making decisions.&nbsp;</li><li>Keep track of your spending. This will help you when it comes to the Qualification and Top-Up Rounds.&nbsp;</li><li>Don’t get greedy! If the banker offers 2x your bet or more, then you should seriously consider it.&nbsp;</li><li>While it is always tempting to switch briefcases at the end of the game, it is not a wise move. This can also mean that you walk away with nothing. At least with the open briefcase you know how much is in it!</li><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Deal or No Deal live odds</h2><p>The odds of winning the biggest prize when playing Deal or No Deal Live are slim. However, you will be guaranteed a payout when you accept the banker’s offer. In most cases, you should only accept when the offer is worth at least 2x your bet. The Return to Player (RTP) is 95.42%, with there being a house edge of 4.58%.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Can I play Deal or No Deal for free?&nbsp;</h2><p>Unfortunately not. Like other live casino games, Deal or No Deal is not available to play for free. This is in contrast to some other game types, including slots and others, which often come with demo modes. As such, in order to access Deal or No Deal Live, you must deposit funds and place real money bets.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Deal or No Deal live at mobile casinos</h2><p>Deal or No Deal Live is available to play on both desktop and mobile. It is hugely convenient being able to place bets on your smartphone or tablet. As such, the majority of casinos have ensured that their <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">mobile casino</a> platforms are quick and easy to use. All of our recommended sites are fully functional when accessed via mobile browsers.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, selected casinos have developed dedicated apps, which are generally available on iOS and Android devices. Either way, there is no need to miss out on playing Deal or No Deal Live because you are away from your laptop or computer.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is the maximum payout in Deal or No Deal live?</h2><p>Through the First Person Deal or No Deal game show, you can win up to 500x your stake. In order to qualify, three gold segments must be unlocked, before topping up as many briefcases as you please. During this version, both “fast” and “normal” speed options are available to players. During the main game, each spin sets the amount in the prize briefcase, starting at 75x your bet.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is the best Deal or No Deal Live Casino?</h2><p>Many of the leading online casinos in the UK now feature Deal or No Deal Live. This is because they are associated with Evolution Gaming. As such, players have a whole host of options. When selecting the best Deal or No Deal live casino for you, be sure to consider other games, payment methods, <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">casino bonuses</a> and mobile platforms.</p><p>Of course, all the mentioned casinos are excellent venues, but right now we would most recommend <a aria-label="MrQ (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">MrQ</a>, thanks to its no-deposit offer. All the casinos listed here are legal in Great Britain, thanks to being licensed and regulated by the UK Gambling Commission..</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Deal or No Deal rigged?&nbsp;</h2><p>Absolutely not. Deal or No Deal Live comes from the studio of Evolution Gaming, one of the most reputable software providers around. Games are controlled by trustworthy and professional hosts, with results being determined using a Random Number Generator (RNG). However, the RTP sits at 95.42%, meaning that you will win less often than with some other live casino games.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What other live casino games can I play?&nbsp;</h2><p>There is certainly no shortage of <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">live casino games</a> available online today.
