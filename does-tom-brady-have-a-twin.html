In addition to his long, winning career in the <a href=#>NFL</a>, Tom also married one of the world's biggest supermodels and seems to have a loving and supportive home life. While plenty of his fans know a lot about his career on the field, some of the <a href=#>Super Bowl MVP</a>'s biggest fans know less about where he comes from.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Tom Brady have a twin sister?</h2><p>Tom was born in California in the late 1970s and is the youngest of four children. While he doesn't have a <a href=#>twin</a> sister, he does share a birthday with his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">older sister Julie</a>, who is exactly three years older than him. And so, whenever he celebrates a birthday, he often jokes that he's wishing his 'twin' sister Julie a happy birthday as well.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tom recently turned 43.</h2><p>To celebrate his 43rd birthday and Julie's 46th, Tom posted an image of the two of them on his Instagram page. "I want to wish a happy birthday to my sister, Julie!! You’ve always had a smile on your face, which has always kept one on mine. I feel so lucky to have you as my big sis!!" Tom wrote. The post led to questions about whether he had a twin, even though he does not.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tom Brady is preparing for his first season as a Buccaneer.</h2><p>Although he's 43 now, Tom is showing no signs of slowing down. The quarterback, who spent his entire career with the New England Patriots, was recently traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Now, Tom is out to prove that he's still got the talent needed to take his team all the way. In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">discussing his decision</a> to leave the Patriots, Tom was kind and diplomatic about the opportunity he'd had on the team.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"There's no one who is a bigger fan of the Patriots than me. I have nothing but total respect and love. I'm so grateful to Mr Kraft, the organization and coach Belichick," Tom said at the time. He also said he was looking forward to his opportunity in Tampa Bay.&nbsp;</p><p>"I don’t want to talk about the past because that’s not relevant to what’s important to my future and what’s going on this off season for me," he explained.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>At 43, Tom will be one of the oldest quarterbacks in the league, but there are many who believe he's the greatest to ever play the game. Now that he's been separated from the Patriots, he'll have a lot to prove in the year ahead. That's assuming, of course, that the NFL manages to get a season off the ground amidst the coronavirus pandemic.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The NFL is moving ahead, but some have questions.</h2><p>Although the NFL is moving forward as if there will be a season, some players have chosen to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">opt-out</a> for the year as a result of the virus. Others have tested positive, and some have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">suggested</a> that the entire season should be canceled until the virus is under control and doesn't pose a risk to players and staff.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbymv4ytpqZlkqeupcWMoZivnV2WerXDyKc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
