With fame comes praises, and whether you like it or not, some sort of criticism.&nbsp;</p><h3>2014 Memorabilia Scheme</h3><p>Back in 2014, Manning was accused of participating in a fake memorabilia scheme alongside the Giants equipment manager Joe Skiba. Apparently, it was said that Manning, including others, was selling equipment that was used.&nbsp;</p><p>As the case continued, it only came to an end in 2018. According to the sources, they settled the argument and lawsuit with a confidential settlement agreement. To illustrate, the lawsuit was filed by Eric Inselberg, Michael Jakab, and Sean Godown.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, their case was against the New York Giants, Eli Manning, John Mara, William Heller, Joseph Skiba, Edward Skiba, and Steiner Sports. Also, the lawsuit claimed that they would store used jerseys for “beat up” to make them look authentic.&nbsp;</p><p>As proof, they had even showcased Manning’s email, which, as explained by the Giant’s lawyers, was taken out of context.</p><p>Additionally, during the 2017 interviews, Manning denied the accusations against him. As of now, the trials and lawsuits are over. Therewith, the Giants had stated, “focused on football, the fans, and the future.”</p><h3>San Diego Chargers and Eli Manning&nbsp;</h3><p>Manning commenced his professional career after the San Diego Chargers drafted him in the 2004 NFL Draft as the first overall pick in the first round. However, Manning hasn’t ever played for the team to date that drafted him.&nbsp;</p><p>Altogether not much has been known about why he did so, but Archie Manning later opened up the reasons behind it. The first and foremost reason, as he says, is actually that the Chargers were doing poorly back then.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, Archie didn’t want Eli to end up like him; thus, Manning’s agent Tom Condon told them that Eli would sit out for the 2004 season. Apart from it, Archie stated that Eli was more suited for the Giants; therewith, they traded him to the Giants.&nbsp;</p><h2>Eli Manning | Earnings | Net Worth&nbsp;</h2><p>After 16 years old NFL career, the Giants’ footballer, Manning retired with a total net worth of $150 million.</p><p>At the time of retirement, he was the highest-earning player in the league with a $252 million salary.<br>Off the football field, Manning was one of the highest-paid endorsers during their professional career. He made around $8-$10 million a year. Manning had so many other ventures, which helped to add to his total net worth.</p><h3>Charity</h3><p>Manning had started the “Eli & Abby Manning Birthing Center” at St. Vincent’s Hospital in Greenwich Village, Manhattan, alongside his wife. Apparently, this project cost them $10 million.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides their sole project, Manning has also donated $1 million to the Children’s of Mississippi and a $100 million capital campaign.</p><p>Furthermore, he and Abby together have opened the Eli Manning Children’s Clinics at Batson Children’s Hospital in Mississippi.</p><h3>House</h3><p>Back in 2016, Manning had purchased a 7,000-square-foot home on a 1.2-acre beachside lot in the Hamptons town of Quogue for $8.5 million.&nbsp;</p><p>Before buying their summer home, he sold his waterfront property — with a view of the New York City skyline — for $3.55 million.</p><h2>Eli Manning | Social Media</h2><p>People may not believe that Eli was not using any social platforms during his 16 seasons NFL career.
