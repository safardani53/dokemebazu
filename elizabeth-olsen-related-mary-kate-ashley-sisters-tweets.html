One fan pointed this out, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>writing</a>, “That ‘People Don’t Know Elizabeth Olsen Is Related To Mary-Kate and Ashley’ thing has been trending for like three days. We often forget that a sizable portion of MCU fans are tweens or younger; is there any reason someone born after 2000 should even know who the Olsen twins are?”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Elizabeth Olsen is so talented that most people don’t realize the she’s the little sister of the Olsen twins. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/lLJUiAXAJI</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-16>— Shelton J.

However, some saw this as a good sign, since Elizabeth could stand on her own as an actress and not just because of her familiar last name (refer to WWE star <strong>Shelton J. Benjamin</strong>‘s tweet above).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/marykate-ashley-elizabeth-olsen-ap-embed.jpg>This freakout on Twitter should be good news for Elizabeth, who recently admitted that she wanted to do her acting career “alone” and not build it off her <a href=#>older sisters’ fame</a>. “Nepotism is a thing and I’m very aware of it. And of course, I’ve always wanted to do it alone,” the MCU actress told <a href=# rel=nofollow>Grazia USA</a> after WandaVision premiered on Disney+ on Jan. 15, 2021.<p id=content-paragraph-20>After a handful of her childhood roles on her sisters’ acting projects, Elizabeth made her breakthrough in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her early 20’s</a> in the films Silent House&nbsp;and&nbsp;Martha Marcy May Marlene, which were both released in 2011. Meanwhile, the Olsen twins have retired from acting and are now hotshots in the high-fashion world as the founders of The Row.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH1ze5FuZp6kma%2Buo7HToWSopKOau26%2BxKWYrZ2UYrqivthmopqslWKutLTLnrBmq5mowaa%2B0marsJ2VqcBw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
