The Sweden native stood in front of her window while holding her 7-month-old in the mother-daughter shots.</p><p>When an Instagram troll told Hosk that they had “reported” the social media upload for the little one’s safety, she defended the shots.</p><p>“Wow. Posting a picture where I’m with my baby naked is not child pornography,” the model wrote via Instagram Stories later that same day. “It’s a normal thing. Happens every day. All over the world. And if I choose to post that, that’s my choice. If some sick person on the internet thinks it’s porn, that’s the person’s problem, not mine. I refuse to live my life according to or in fear of sick people on the internet. I don’t live in that fear.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Elsa-Hosk-Defends-Posting-Nude-Photos-With-Daughter-2.jpg><p>Hosk called “being naked with [her] baby the most beautiful” thing, gushing, “Skin to skin … creates hormones that help both of us to connect and have a stronger bond. How beautiful is that? … Don’t worry about the safety of my baby, she is right where she belongs, literally in my naked arms.”</p><p>The former professional basketball player went on to reflect on her childhood in Sweden, noting that she was naked often — “at <a href=#>beaches</a>, at home, in public.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Elsa-Hosk-Defends-Posting-Nude-Photos-With-Daughter-3.jpg><p>Hosk concluded, “It was so natural to us, and we were not taught that our bodies were something you had to hide away in fear of what strangers might think. I think it created a very healthy relationship to nudity and to my own body. I never felt weird about being naked.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She and her boyfriend, <strong>Tom Daly</strong>,<a href=#> welcomed Tuulikki</a> in February, five months after <a href=#>their pregnancy reveal</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Elsa-Hosk-Defends-Posting-Nude-Photos-With-Daughter-4.jpg><p>In March, the new mom slammed haters after posting <a href=#>photos nursing</a> her baby girl. “Find it interesting the amount of DMs I get from men who get offended when you post a photo breast-feeding. Like, why is the most natural thing so offending to you?” she wrote via Instagram at the time. “Breasts literally excists [sic] so we can feed our children.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaepKOWeqm70qRknZ2Wmrulv4yppqyhnpx6r8HDnmSwoaSdeqOtwbJknZmlnLW1sdFmp6GnpKTAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
