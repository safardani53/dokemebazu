The former are seeking trophies, the latter are out to make money.</p><p>“The animals are often kept hidden away in cramped conditions and go without food or water for long periods of time. Inevitably, many die before they are even sold. Perhaps they are the lucky ones.”</p><p>Richard Thomas, from TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring group, told the Sun Online: “It’s so difficult to police because most of the Facebook groups are private/closed.</p><p>“It’s a new avenue which the criminal underworld will try to exploit."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/exoticanimals4.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/exoticanimals71.jpg><p>Martin Simms, Director of Investigations at the League Against Cruel Sports, has dealt with cases including the attempted sale of dead bats online and the suspected sale of sperm whale teeth hacked from the mouth of a dead whale washed up on a British beach.</p><p>He believes Facebook has a duty to halt any illegal wildlife activity.</p><p>There have also been cases where wild British hedgehogs have been passed off as exotic African Pygmy Hedgehogs by rustlers trying to sell them as pets on Facebook, as well as sites such as Gumtree.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/exoticanimals8.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/otter.jpg><p>In a separate case, in April last year champion cage fighter Steve Dossett sparked outrage when he posted pictures of orphaned fox cubs on his social media page and asked for £120 per animal.</p><p>He posted photos of them in a box in his home and wrote “fox cubs for sale, 120 pounds lovely pets”.</p><p>In another post under another photograph, he wrote "foxes drinking milk out of a bowl, who wants one?"</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>Horrified animal lovers saw the ad and begged him to take the animals to a shelter instead.</p><p>Eventually, a member of Dossett’s family called Surrey-based Wildlife Aid Foundation and volunteers from the charity went to his flat and took seven cubs away.</p><p>A spokesman for Facebook said: "We have now removed all of the groups raised to us by Sun Online.</p><p>"We do not allow the sale of live animals between private individuals, and we will remove any content that violates our policies.”</p><p><b>We pay for your stories!
