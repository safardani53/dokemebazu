Following the overwhelming success of the movie, many want to know what Fantasia's net worth is.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Fantasia Barrino's net worth?</h2><p>In spite of her recent success, Fantasia has gone viral recently for a video in which she talks about being poor enough that she couldn't even afford to buy pizza. She reminded everyone that she had been working steadily on Broadway for years, but because she had such an extensive team, she rarely made any money herself. “I would get home and couldn’t even order a pizza. But I was never home. So, how’s that I ain’t got no money, but I’m always working? [sic]” she explained.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Everybody saw the gift, but they saw the opportunity to make money from the gift. So, I felt like I was carrying my cross ... and that was heavy for me," she continued.</p><p>Fantasia also said that much of her earnings had gone to surgeries to remove tumors from her vocal cords, which were certainly necessary if she wanted to continue performing the way that she had been.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Fantasia Barrino</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Singer/Actress</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $500,000</p><p>Fantasia Barrino is a singer and actress who first came to fame after winning season 3 of American Idol.

Henson has been public about the fact that she asked for $500,000 for the movie and only received $150,000. Like Fantasia, Taraji has been open while promoting The Color Purple about the issues she's had with making money in Hollywood.</p><p>This remarkable honesty about pay disparities in Hollywood has many taking note, especially because major Black female stars seem to be unable to pay for the basics. One can only hope that Fantasia and Taraji will be able to share in some of the success that The Color Purple has achieved, and that it will lead to better pay for them on future projects.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfm66vwMCsoJplkpa%2Fs7XNqGSnnaRixLC%2B06E%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
