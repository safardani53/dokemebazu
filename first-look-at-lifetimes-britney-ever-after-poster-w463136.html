The poster for Lifetime’s highly anticipated <b><a href=#>Britney Spears</a></b> biopic,&nbsp;<i>Britney Ever After</i>, was just released, and <i>Us Weekly</i> has the exclusive first look.&nbsp;</p><p>The unauthorized TV film, which will premiere on Saturday, February 18,&nbsp;follows Spears’ rise, fall and road back to success. Australian actress&nbsp;<b></b><a href=#><b>Natasha Bassett</b> will portray the 35-year-old songstress</a> in the flick, which chronicles the most iconic moments of Spears’ life. Several of her high-profile relationships will be documented, including her romance with <b><a href=#>Justin Timberlake</a></b> from 1999 to 2002, her 55-hour marriage to Jason Alexander in 2004 and her three-year marriage to <b><a href=#>Kevin Federline</a></b>, with whom she shares sons Sean and Jayden.&nbsp;</p><span class=caption></span><p>The Mississippi-born singer’s 2007 meltdown will also be depicted. In the first trailer for the film, released on Monday, January 23, scenes showed Spears shaving her head and her infamous umbrella attack on a paparazzi’s car.

I really appreciated how strong she is. Emotionally, the way she got through the constant pressures that she was faced with is admirable.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>The Grammy winner has not given her stamp of approval to the film. Her rep previously told <i>Us</i> that she “will not be contributing in any way, shape or form to the Lifetime biopic, nor does it have her blessing.”</p><p><i>Britney Ever After</i> premieres on Lifetime on Saturday, February 18.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ2iqqOpeq27zqRkmqxdobansdOipJ6rXZe%2FqsDNnrBmnaaav26txa2cq2WgpMC1sdFmrm1uY2aAd3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
