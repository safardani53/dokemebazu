She had romantic plans with her husband for the day, in addition to the pregnancy announcement. She received some late-night dessert to sweeten things up even further.</p><h2>Gabby Barrett’s Pregnancy Announcement and Cake for Mother’s Day</h2><p>Barrett and Foehner announced on Instagram on May 8 that they were expecting their second child together. They both shared an ultrasound video of their new baby developing within her tummy. Barrett described her kid in her post. “Yet another LIFE to love and cherish.”&nbsp;She wished everyone a happy Mother’s Day at the conclusion of her brief caption. Foehner’s piece on the subject was a little more detailed.</p><p>In his post, She added,</p><p>“Happy Mother’s Day to my lovely, strong, and fertile Bride!” “She’s carrying another beautiful life right now.”</p><p>He also said that their upcoming child was a male. He expressed his love for his wife in a biblically lyrical style.”Our children will rise up and declare her blessed,” he said, expressing his pleasure in his wife and what he anticipated of his children. He concluded his letter with Proverbs 31:28: “Praise God, from whom all benefits flow!”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Gabby-Barrett-2.jpg alt="Gabby Barrett" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Later that day, the couple went out to eat to commemorate the anniversary, which was made much more memorable by their pregnancy. Barrett was seen eating what seemed to be chocolate cake after dinner in a photo taken by Foehner during their night out.</p><p>“Mother’s Day supper for this beauty,” he captioned the photo.&nbsp;The comments on all of these postings were generally celebratory and supportive, with a few attempts at drama.</p><h2>Gabby Barrett’s Relationship with Her Husband Cade Foehner</h2><p>Barrett and Foehner first met on the American Idol stage in 2018, after reaching the Top 24. And, while everyone else was looking at her (she went on to finish third and win a few honors), she was looking at him.&nbsp;She felt strongly about him and made the first move. He appropriately responded, and so their romance started.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Gabby-Barrett-3.jpg alt="Gabby Barrett" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>On October 5, 2021, the pair will marry in a “rustic” Texas ceremony. She was 19 at the time, and he was 23.&nbsp;Barrett and Foehner had their first child, daughter Baylah May Foehner, on January 18, 2021, after announcing their pregnancy in August 2020. Foehner matured as a mom when Baylah was developing within her. He was “particularly considerate” and sympathetic with her mood swings, and the time they spent preparing for Baylah’s birth drew them closer together.&nbsp;Barrett stated that her life and priorities have shifted with the arrival of her lullaby baby. And with the advent of her kid, things may shift even more.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiempqSrnqjrdGrnK2sXZa7r7vUp5qenF2dsrN5z6ucoKaRo7C6ec6nZKanpJ2ys7%2BMnZiyZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
