Fans and artists alike lost part of the <a href=#>Gillie Da Kid</a> dynasty when his eldest son, 25-year-old <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YNG Cheese</a>, was killed in a triple shooting on July 20. While police did not confirm that the 25-year-old shot in the back was YNG Cheese, sources close to the family began sharing their memories publicly.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Gillie Da Kid is one of Philly’s most influential musicians over the past few decades, and he’s built up a family dynasty of his kids who have followed in his footsteps. He and his wife of 25 years, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Regina Little</a>, have five children together and one grandchild. So who are all of Gillie Da Kid’s children?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Gillie Da Kid and Regina Little have five children together, including YNG Cheese.</h2><p>Gillie and Regina married in 1998 and have grown together to become successful individually. Gillie co-hosts the hip-hop podcast <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Million Dollaz Worth of Game</a> alongside <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wallace Peeples</a>, who first publicly shared his condolences for YNG Cheese. With 3.2 million Instagram followers, Gillie is an unmatched force in his community.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Similarly, Regina is an Emmy-nominated makeup artist who worked on shows such as Chase Street and <a href=#>WandaVision</a>. Regina and Gillie had five children, the eldest being YNG Cheese. About one year later, they brought their second child, Mac, into the world. Like their father, YNG and Mac have pursued a music career.</p><p>Mac goes by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TR3Y SEVEN7</a> as a solo artist, but he and his older brother formed the hip-hop duo Macc N Cheese. In 2021, they released their debut album and have continued releasing music together since.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Gillie and Regina’s third child, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nyla</a>, has also maintained her image in the public eye. She graduated high school in 2020 and wanted to become an attorney. However, her Instagram bio now says “music otw,” hinting that she’ll also release some tracks. The other two “Da Kid” children seem to stay out of the limelight, so less is known about them.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">YNG Cheese had one son, making Gillie Da Kid a grandfather.</h2><p>Gillie and Regina are very young grandparents, but they are proud grandparents nonetheless. On April 15, 2021, YNG Cheese’s son, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chase Amari Dash,</a> was born. YNG and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cherie B</a> announced the pregnancy in 2020, and although they split up shortly after Chase’s birth, they are both very involved in Chase’s life.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Since their split, Cherie has posted very little on social media, although she began sharing her journey with post-partum depression. Just three days before YNG’s untimely death, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cherie shared a clip</a> with a caption about why she and YNG decided to split. Sadly, Chase will now grow up without a father, although we expect that Gillie and Regina will still be very involved in his life.</p><p>Artists and friends have been quick to share their condolences after the news of YNG Cheese’s death. Police have yet to relay exactly what happened, so all we know is that in the late hours of Thursday, July 20, three men were shot. While the other two men—a 28-year-old and a 31-year-old—are now in stable condition, YNG Cheese was not as lucky.</p><p>Our condolences go out to YNG’s friends, family, and fans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnLatuMieZJ2ZXaC2pXnCoaClnKKauw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
