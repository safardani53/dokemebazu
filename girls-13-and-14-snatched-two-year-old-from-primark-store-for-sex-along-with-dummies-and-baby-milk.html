There is evidence to support that the young girls in question had been researching rape.</p><p>“A tablet contained a number of particular searches for rape, people getting raped, young people getting raped, poor little thing getting kidnapped and raped and African woman sexual activity.</p><p>“The young child in this case is a black child.”</p><p>The little girl was found in a park in the suburb of Gosforth an hour and 45 minutes later.</p><p>She was reunited with her mum after being tracked by CCTV camera operators from the city centre, on the Metro system and along Gosforth High Street and into a park.</p><p>The&nbsp;pair&nbsp;had originally been charged with kidnap with the intention of committing a relevant sexual offence but this was "discontinued" at the hearing and the prosecution accepted a plea to the alternative charge of kidnap.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nintchdbpict0002346288941-e1465295492743.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">RELATED STORIES</h2></p><p>The girl's father yesterday told of the family's terror when she was taken and revealed they are still tormented by thoughts of what the sisters had been planning.</p><p>He said: “As a parent you ask yourself - what was their intent?</p><p>“Yes, she was found safe and well but what if the police had not found her until 6pm or 7pm when it was dark - what then?</p><p>“There is relief they have pleaded guilty but not full relief because we don't know why they did it and what they intended to do.</p><p>“You never forget the guilt of losing her.</p><p>“Her mother was on the phone and our daughter was in her pram. They offered her sweets, she was hysterical and they got her out and started playing with her around the shop.</p><p>“Thankfully the police did an amazing job and the people of Newcastle came together to help us. We are so grateful that she was unharmed.</p><p>“We want to thank the police and the city of Newcastle.”</p><p>District Judge Roger Elsey today&nbsp;said the issue of "dangerousness" must be considered. He said:&nbsp;"There is some very concerning material on the tablet that was recovered.</p><p>"That is going to have to inform the assessment of dangerousness."</p><p>Lee Poppett, prosecuting, told the previous youth court hearing at South East Northumberland Magistrates' Court: "There is several links to 'African woman sexual activity' and the young child in this case is black."</p><p>Poppett described the failed abduction, which happened two hours earlier in the same Primark store, with the two teens playing with the little girl moments before her mum lost sight of her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nintchdbpict000234646123.jpg><p>In the earlier kidnapping attempt, one of the girls approached the mum and asked if she was looking for a little girl with a green coat, and told her to go to the counter as that's where the child was.</p><p>The mum turned around in the other direction and saw her daughter there in the abduction attempt, two hours before the successful kidnap.</p><p>Both girls, who cannot be identified, have no criminal record and have never been arrested or cautioned.</p><p>They had a history of going missing from their Tyneside home and were known to social services although they were not in care at the time of the offence in April.</p><p>The girls appeared at a youth court hearing in North Tyneside and pleaded guilty to three joint offences - kidnap, theft of dummies and theft of baby bottle and milk..</p><p>Their alleged victim cannot be identified for legal reasons.</p><p>District Judge Roger Elsey adjourned the case for reports to be made.</p><p>It will be back before the youth court at North Shields on July 4, when the prosecution will outline their case and the defence will put forward mitigation.</p><p>The judge told the girls they may yet be sentenced in the Crown Court.</p><p>They were remanded into the care of the local authority in the meantime.</p><p>Chief Superintendent Laura Young, of Northumbria Police, said: “To lose a child, or have a child taken from you in these circumstances, must be every parent's worst nightmare.</p><p>“I am just glad that we are in a position today where the child is safely back home and hopefully this awful incident can be put behind them.</p><p>“The fact that this is the case is down to the excellent work of our officers on that day and the support we received from partners and the public."</p><p><b>We pay for your stories!
