Love you #happythanksgiving."</p><p>Although Marilee's account is now private, her followers can see that she edited the post after originally writing it.</p><p>The post appears to have been shared on <a href=#>Thanksgiving</a>, only a few days before <a href=#>TJ</a>'s <a href=#>cheating scandal</a> came out.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE TJ HOLMES">READ MORE TJ HOLMES</h2><p>Marilee got the support of Al's wife, Deborah, who is part of the ABC News family.</p><p>Deborah commented a few red heart emojis on her post.</p><p>TJ was accused of cheating with his co-host <a href=#>Amy Robach</a>, and <a href=#>other women at his workplace</a>.</p><p>Marilee and TJ got married in 2010 and share a nine-year-old daughter named Sabine.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h2>'BETTER OFF'</h2><p>In a resurfaced clip from Entertainment Tonight, TJ <a href=#>praised marriage</a> and said that "everyone should do it."</p><p>“I’m such a marriage proponent," the <a href=#>GMA</a> host said.</p><p>"I want everybody to get married," he said. "I think everybody should and I think you’re better off in doing so.”</p><p>In the interview, he also stated that "marriage gets a bad rap so many times."</p><h2>BIG TROUBLE</h2><p>TJ is under investigation for <a href=#>violating his contract</a> after his affairs with Amy and an ABC employee, a source told The U.S. Sun.</p><p>According to recent reports,&nbsp;the 45-year-old, engaged in a&nbsp;<a href=#>long-term relationship with&nbsp;married show producer Natasha Singh</a>&nbsp;while he was a&nbsp;GMA&nbsp;correspondent.</p><p>The U.S. Sun has obtained and reviewed a copy of ABC talent's relationship clause, and one network source claimed the contract may have been violated when&nbsp;TJ allegedly began dating Natasha in 2016.</p><p>"There is an internal investigation&nbsp;into TJ's relationship&nbsp;with the producer," the network source said.</p><p>According to the source, the fact that TJ may have been in a position to assign Natasha tasks makes the relationship problematic.</p><p>The contract states: "Relationships between employees (including non-managerial employees) where one employee assigns the work duties or sets the work schedule of the other" may be prohibited.</p><p>The contract also prohibits relationships "where the nature of the employees’ respective positions in the Company, or the functions they perform, could compromise the business judgment of one or both of the employees."</p><p>The source said while it's unclear if TJ and Natasha's relationship compromised their business judgment, that is something ABC will look into during their investigation.</p><p>The network source added that TJ was not separated when he engaged in a romance with Natasha- which is a bad look for the family-friendly company.</p><h2>A SECOND AFFAIR</h2><p>As widely reported, TJ began dating co-host Amy earlier this year- reportedly when both were still married to other people. (Other sources insist both Amy and TJ were both separated from their respective spouses at the time.)</p><p>Last week,&nbsp;<a href=#>The Daily Mail</a>&nbsp;first shared&nbsp;<a href=#>shocking photos of TJ and Amy on romantic dates&nbsp;</a>and even a weekend getaway together.</p><p>Though the pair initially remained on air to host GMA3 for two days,&nbsp;<a href=#>Amy and TJ were removed from the show&nbsp;</a>on Monday morning.&nbsp;</p><p>Stephanie Ramos and&nbsp;<a href=#>Gio Benitez</a>&nbsp;will host the show for the time being while ABC figures out how to move forward with the&nbsp;<a href=#>scandal</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The source told The U.S. Sun: "They were taken off the air to calm things down.</p><p>"There has been no determination of any violation of any ABC policies by either one of them," a second insider added. &nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The third insider said that there is no timeline for Amy or TJ to return to their hosting gigs.</p><p>ABC declined to comment on this story, and reps for TJ and Amy did not comment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/gma3-need-know-airs-monday-780815466-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/amy-robach-tj-holmes-dr-780886798-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/gmas-tj-holmes-sparks-concern-773392227.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huaGp%2Fc4GUaJ6mmV2pt260zqWknqtdrLansYysn5qclah6tMHPqaarrF2WuW6%2BzqScq2WnnrOmew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
