I do feel very strongly, because I think we have a moral responsibility to say, ‘Hang on, guys, this is not … it’s not a drama-doc, we’re making a drama,’” the actress, 54, said on “<a href=#>The Crown: The Official Podcast</a>” on the Monday, November 30, episode. “So, they are two different entities.”</p><p>She went on to add that the “proper documentary” is the “amazing” research the show’s creator, <strong>Peter Morgan</strong>, does ahead of time. After doing that, “then <a href=#>Peter switches things up and juggles</a>,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Helena-Bonham-Carter-The-Crown-Moral-Responsibility-Labeled-Fiction.jpg><p>Season 4 of the show, which chronicles <a href=#><strong>Prince Charles</strong></a>‘ messy relationship with <a href=#><strong>Princess Diana</strong></a>, has caused an uproar due to the negative portrayal of the royal family and the way things were run. British politician <strong>Oliver Dowden</strong> recently also urged the streaming service to start with a disclaimer.</p><p>“It’s a beautifully produced work of fiction, so as with other TV productions, Netflix should be very clear at the beginning it is just that,” he told the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a> on Saturday, November 28. “Without this, I fear a generation of viewers who did not live through these events may mistake fiction for fact.”</p><p>Diana’s younger brother <a href=#><strong>Earl Charles Spencer</strong></a> also spoke out about the show’s inaccuracies.</p><p>“The Crown asked if they could film at Althorp, and I said, ‘Obviously not,’” he recalled on a recent episode of Love Your Weekend with Alan Titchmarsh. “The worry for me is that people see a program like that, and they forget that it is fiction. They assume, especially foreigners, I find Americans tell me they have watched The Crown as if they have taken a history lesson. Well, they haven’t. It is very hard, there is a lot of conjecture and a lot of invention, isn’t there? <a href=#>You can hang it on fact, but the bits in between are not fact</a>.”</p><p>Morgan, 57, told <a href=#>The Times</a> on November 20 that the streaming service has never advertised the show as a documentary.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We do our very, very best to get it right, but sometimes I have to conflate [events],” the screenwriter said at the time. “You sometimes have to forsake accuracy, but you must never forsake truth.”</p><p>Us Weekly has reached out to Netflix for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ%2BepJWjrm6uzqefmqVdmK6zwMSrZK2glWKws7vWp2SsoJ%2BquaV5wJ2bZp6ZmMGqu81mm6Krk6GuqrnEq2Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
