Here's how you join in on the fun!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok / @aimusic15 / @y.esir_ / @aimusiccovers1031</span></figure><p>Unless you live under a rock, you may have noticed that <a href=#>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</a> is taking over the world — and it's currently taking <a href=#>social media by storm</a>. In fact, most of the new songs you hear while scrolling through your "For You Page" on <a href=#>TikTok</a> are produced via AI.</p><p>AI songs have been flooding TikTok for months, and unfortunately, many A-list artists have been included in the new trend. <a href=#>Ariana Grande</a> covered nearly every song on <a href=#>SZA</a>'s sophomore album "SOS," the late <a href=#>Michael Jackson</a> covered <a href=#>The Weeknd</a>'s "I Feel It Coming," and <a href=#>Kanye West</a> even belted out <a href=#>Adele</a>'s award-winning ballad "Hello."</p><p>This practice has become insanely popular, so much so that many people are wondering how they can make their own AI-generated covers. Read on to learn more, but beware — artists and music labels are speaking out against this.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here's how to make AI song covers!</h2><p>Most creators producing AI-generated covers use open-source software like SoftVC VITS Singing Voice Conversion and DiffSVC. However, there are various other options, including Musicfy, VoxBox, MusicAI, Soundful, Singify, Aiva, Voicedub, MelodyStudio, Voicify.ai, Boomy, Mubert, and Beatbot.</p><p>Now, when it comes to actually making the AI-generated covers, you'll sometimes have to download the system to your computer (or sign up for an account). From there, you can choose a voice filter you want to use. There's often a wide variety to choose from, including chart-topping singers, cartoon characters, and government officials.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@eactron href=#>@eactron</a><p>Plankton Sings Diamonds Full Version! <a title=plankton href=#>#plankton</a> <a title=spongebob href=#>#spongebob</a> <a title=aiplankton href=#>#aiplankton</a> <a title=planktonspongebob href=#>#planktonspongebob</a> <a title=aicover href=#>#Aicover</a> <a title=songcovers href=#>#songcovers</a> <a title=planktonsinging href=#>#planktonsinging</a> <a title=chumbucket href=#>#chumbucket</a> <a title=planktondiamonds href=#>#planktondiamonds</a> <a title=planktonai href=#>#planktonai</a> <a title=diamonds href=#>#diamonds</a> <a title=rihanna href=#>#rihanna</a> <a title=aicovers href=#>#aicovers</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - eactron - eactron" href=#>♬ original sound - eactron - eactron</a></figure><p>Then, you can either upload a song in MP3 format, select one from the service's library, or open a music streaming application for recording. Edit it to your liking, and voila! You've officially produced an AI song. When all is said and done, you can download the AI-generated cover and share it for everyone to enjoy.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here are some of our favorite AI-generated covers.</h2><p>Unfortunately, we can't spotlight every single AI-generated cover on social media — but we can definitely take the time to appreciate some of our favorites (all of them are performed by cartoon characters).</p><p>On July 13, TikTok user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@eactron</a> uploaded a nearly four-minute video of Plankton — the antagonist from Spongebob Squarepants — singing Rihanna's smash-hit "Diamonds." Plankton sings his little heart out; we can hear the passion, so much so that we almost shed a tear!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@sadashilyricss href=#>@sadashilyricss</a><p>Squidward Patrick and SpongeBob sing this song. <a title=fy href=#>#fy</a> <a title=lyrics href=#>#lyrics</a> <a title=music href=#>#music</a> <a title=fypシ゚viral href=#>#fypシ゚viral</a></p><a title="♬ Squidward Patrick and SpongeBob sing this song. - part of king." href=#>♬ Squidward Patrick and SpongeBob sing this song. - part of king.</a></figure><p>There are endless AI-generated covers featuring the Spongebob main characters, but two of our favorites see them perform Shawn Mendes' "Treat You Better" and the Backstreet Boys' "I Want It That Way." In both covers, every single character delivers pure excellence — but the standout performers are Squidward and Patrick.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@aiserenades href=#>@aiserenades</a><p>I want it that way Spongebob Cast Lyric Video <a title=aisong href=#>#aisong</a> <a title=aisongcover href=#>#aisongcover</a> <a title=aisings href=#>#aisings</a> <a title=aiserenades href=#>#aiserenades</a> <a title=spongebob href=#>#spongebob</a> <a title=backstreetboys href=#>#backstreetboys</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - AI Serenades" href=#>♬ original sound - AI Serenades</a></figure><p>Now, this clip of Homer Simpon covering Eminem's "The Real Slim Shady" is straight fire.

His version of Evanescence's "Bring Me to Life" has unironically been our song of the summer — it truly has no reason or right to be that freaking good. Seriously, we could listen to Cartman belt this out all day.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@aimusic15 href=#>@aimusic15</a><p>Part 26 | Eric Cartman Sings "Bring Me To Life" By Evanescence <a title=aicover href=#>#aicover</a> <a title=viraltiktok href=#>#viraltiktok</a> <a title=rock href=#>#rock</a> <a title=evanescence href=#>#evanescence</a> <a title=bringmetolife href=#>#bringmetolife</a> <a title=ericcartman href=#>#ericcartman</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a></p><a title="♬ Don't Let Me Go - Lane 8 & Arctic Lake" href=#>♬ Don't Let Me Go - Lane 8 & Arctic Lake</a></figure><p>Luckily, it seems others agree because the AI-generated cover has since gone viral on TikTok, with many claiming it's now their go-to song at the gym.
