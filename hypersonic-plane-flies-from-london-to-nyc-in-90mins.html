we just spend less energy for this," he added.</p><p>The plan is to start moving urgent, high-value cargo first- medical supplies, secure documents, critical infrastructure parts.</p><p>But eventually, the drone will be used to move commercial goods without boosting their prices.</p><p>"Amazing tuna from the Mediterranean will be in the kitchen of Japanese restaurants as fresh as if it's just been caught, eventually at the same price," he said.</p><p>But these plans are still years away and the hypersonic flight is an unknown territory for many countries' regulators.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Hypersonic trials are obstructed by the lack of long-distance test "corridors".</p><p>Only two prototypes have been tested so far, with one having a "hard landing" during the maiden flight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/essentially-half-rocket-half-plane-820657639.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2cnKBfZ4F6hZFpa25nmK69pr7SqKWim12luaK6xGadpaGVqHqnvs6mZKWnnpm8r3nTqGSnsZNitq95mGmkoqajZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
