Many even make money from it, which makes it all the more frustrating when certain features don't work.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>On May 10, 2022, a number of <a href=#>Instagram</a> users took to Twitter to complain that they weren't able to send messages on the app. "Why while sending an Insta post to someone via DM on Instagram it says 'Failed to Send Message'?" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one person tweeted</a>.</p><p>So, what's going on with Instagram? Lots of people are getting the same "Failed to Send Message" error. If you're one of them, here's how to fix it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here's how to fix the "Failed to Send Message" error notification on Instagram.</h2><p>The first step to figuring out why you can't send messages is determining who is at fault. Sometimes, there are issues with Instagram or Meta, its parent company, that have nothing to do with you. In those instances, there really isn't anything you can do to fix the problem, and you just have to wait it out.</p><p>Especially when you consider that so many people across Instagram are having the same issue at the same time, it's unlikely that this messaging problem was caused by something the users did.</p><p>Luckily, some users have found simple ways to get their Instagram messages back on track. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Some sources say</a> people had success uninstalling and reinstalling the app, clearing the app's cache, and making sure it is updated to the latest version. And, of course, there's always the old and faithful trick of restarting your phone.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As of now, Instagram hasn't said anything to acknowledge what happened with its messaging system. But since people have seen some success with fixing the issue using the methods mentioned, the social media platform may not say anything at all.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Instagram block me from messaging?</h2><p>Instagram may be preventing you from messaging other people because you have sent too many. In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the help section</a>, Instagram states that it puts this limit in place to prevent people from getting spam. Initially, the app will warn you if you're close to hitting that limit. If you continue to send messages, though,, you will be prevented from sending any more.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Why while sending an insta post to someomlne via DM on instagram it says: Failed to send message ??

But if a notification pops up on your screen saying that you have been blocked from a certain action, typically a time period will be given.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>If you find out you were blocked from messaging and don't think Instagram should have done that, you can report the problem by shaking your phone.
