The 30-year-old is also an awards darling and recently headed into the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2023 CMA Awards</a> on November 8 with four nominations, including Entertainer of the Year and Album of the Year.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Now, his fans will be able to catch him during the New Year’s Eve Live: Nashville’s Big Bash special on CBS on December 31, 2023. Morgan is scheduled to perform to ring in the New Year along with other performers including <strong>Thomas Rhett</strong>, <strong>Lynyrd Skynyrd</strong>, and <strong>Lainey Wilson</strong>. But one thing that Morgan is still figuring out is his romantic relationships. Here’s everything you need to know about the “Whiskey Glasses” singer’s love life.</p><h2>Is Morgan Wallen Married?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>No, Morgan Wallen is not married. However, he did come close to walking down the aisle when he was engaged to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>KT Smith</strong></a>. The former couple reportedly met on Snapchat years ago and were engaged within months. They broke off their engagement but stayed together until late 2019.</p><h2>Why Did Morgan Wallen and KT Smith Call Off Their Engagement?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>KT opened up about her split from Morgan on her blog <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Backstory</a> in 2021. “That third year was rocky,” she wrote.&nbsp;“The kind of toxic, trauma bond you hear about on TikTok. We were off and on the third year, still talking 24/7 and seeing each other every time he was in town and I would still go on the road with him. But being thrown into the spotlight at such a young age is obviously going to come with some bad decisions. He wasn’t the most faithful.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/morgan-wallen-cancels-tour-dates-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Before they broke up for good, KT got pregnant with their son <strong>Indigo Wilder</strong>, who was born on July 10, 2020. Morgan told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a> that he’s “thankful” he co-parents his son “with someone I care about.” He added, “We’re doing our best to figure it out, just trying to do the best we can with the situation. I mean, many people have been in this situation before — having a kid with someone you’re not with — but knowing that doesn’t make it any easier.”</p><h2>Who Else Has Morgan Wallen Dated?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Morgan was in a brief relationship with influencer <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Paige Lorenze</a></strong>. They made their relationship IG official in February of 2022, but they broke up several weeks later. Paige previously dated <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Armie Hammer</strong>.&nbsp;</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>In the fall of 2022, Morgan was linked to fellow country star <strong>Megan Moroney</strong> after she wore the same shirt as Morgan for the art of her single “Tennessee Orange.” When asked in November 2022 on an episode of Sirius XM’s <a tabindex=0 href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-t='{"n":"destination","t":13,"b":1,"c.t":7}' data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Highway,</a> Megan fessed up that it was Morgan’s shirt. “I mean, it is his shirt she said, adding, “But it’s just a shirt.” when asked if she had a boyfriend, she simply responded, “That’s a great question.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8isZKanopyur3nWmqOlnZ5iuqK%2B0aKcnWVlZoV1g5ZvZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
