Strictly is simply too much competition for any new talent show to air and attract a decent crowd. It also doesn't help that people have become bored of the singing show format due to overexposure."</p><p>A second added: "I don't think there is overexposure of the singing format now - other than The Voice Kids think it's the first of the year. Just think Mamma Mia isn't a strong enough musical as a hook for this kind of show."</p><p>A third penned: "There last attempt grease is the word wasn't great either and going against strictly, they're asking for a slaughter."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>A fourth penned: "This show feels like it's 15 years too late..."</p><p>The ITV show will search for two stars to play&nbsp;the roles of Sophie and Sky in&nbsp;Mamma Mia! in Londonâ€™s West End.</p><p>Throughout&nbsp;the series, musical theatre competitors will be put through their paces as they navigate their way through challenges, masterclasses, and performances.</p><p>Zoe Ball hosts the show while the judging panel consists of Jessie Ware, Alan Carr, Samantha Barks and Amber Riley.</p><p>Others were loving the show, with one writing: "I already love Jessie Ware, she seems like a total laugh. This is such a strong judging panel!"</p><p>Another added: "Watching this #MammaMia show and I absolutely love @ZoeTheBall."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/thames-reproduced-editorial-purposes-directly-852756603.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGpkaoFzgpNsZqKspmLApLTEnaylnV2YtaK6xp5kppmdoq5uuciaZKJlmJbDpnnAZpurnZGifA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
