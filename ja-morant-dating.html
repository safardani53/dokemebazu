She played volleyball and basketball at Fisk University but didn't go pro as her then-boyfriend did. Instead, she turned her attention to different entrepreneurial businesses.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>KK wrote a children's book called Kaari & Kree's Ultimate Coloring & Activity Book. "Kadre has always been driven to make a positive impact on the lives of others," explains her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon bio</a>. "Above all else, her favorite position is that of a mother. This passion for community and education fueled her desire to build an uplifting brand that inspires and empowers others."</p><p>KK is also the CEO and owner of Dixon Brands LLC.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ja Morant is in legal trouble.</h2><p>Allegedly, Ja punched a teenager during a pick-up game of basketball in 2022. As a result, he is being sued and his legal team is trying to argue immunity in the case. The judge, however, has declined to give a swift decision on the issue, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AP News</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The attorney argues that Ja felt threatened and under Tennessee’s ground law, which would allow him immunity in this case. Usually, immunity is only offered in criminal cases, but it may be allowed in this civil argument.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“Everybody was hoping for a big decision, or finality, or something like that,” Shelby County Circuit Court Judge Caro Chumney said, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Commercial Appeal</a>. “These are important legal issues.”</p><p>Ja's father confirmed to Sirius XM that his legal issues aren't changing who he keeps around him. "Ja Morant is going to be the typical guy, a family guy that is going to be an inspiration to a lot, especially in South Carolina, Memphis, wherever he’s at. But he’s going to carry himself like a respectable guy," Tee Morant said.</p><p>“We got the same circle. We got the same circle. It’s always funny that people want you to change your circle even if, like, he don’t have no killers around him," he added. "He’s got educated people around him. But everyone else thinks, ‘OK, this person is this, this person is that.’ No! Everybody knows their task. It was a bad decision. But it wasn’t a crime.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn65uuc6rmKesXZmutbXNoA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
