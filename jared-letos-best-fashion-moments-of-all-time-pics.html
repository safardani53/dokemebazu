The ABC drama had a strong season 1 before ending in 1995.</p><p>After his success on the show, Leto went on to star in movies including American Psycho, Fight Club, <a href=#>Girl, Interrupted</a>, Sunset Trip and more.</p><p>Proving he is a man of many talents, the Chapter 27 actor also has killer vocals. The musician and his brother <strong>Shannon Leto</strong> both star in the rock band 30 Seconds to Mars. <a href=#>The Suicide Squad actor</a> has been the lead vocalist and guitarist since 1998.</p><p>With his stardom has come many red carpet moments, and Leto never fails to turn heads with his keen sense of style. In 2016, he became the face of Gucci Guilty fragrance and has continued to work closely with the luxury brand.</p><p>In a June 2021 interview with <a href=#>GQ Magazine</a>, the Haunted Mansion star opened up about his fashion choices. “I don’t spend a lot of time thinking about what I will wear — I tend to just throw things on.
