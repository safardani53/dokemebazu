When asked “You mad your dad knows?” on Q&A website&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ask.fm</a>, Jay simply responded with: “Nope.” Good for him! We’re happy that Jay’s not letting his famous father’s lack of support bring him down.&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>On the same site, Jay also opened up&nbsp;with other details about his transition into becoming a boy. When asked if his mom, <strong>Drea</strong> <strong>Kelly</strong>, refers to him as a boy, Jay&nbsp;responded with “Yep.” Jay also said he ignores questions about his famous father&nbsp;“most of the time” and doesn’t think of himself as a celebrity.&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Considering Jay is only 13, under a major microscope AND&nbsp;receiving little support from his dad, the teen is handling all of this pressure and attention SO well. We’re proud of Jay for being so open, honest and brave!&nbsp;</p><h3>R.Kelly: Don’t Refer To My Transgender Son As A Male</h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>After Jay’s brave confession, his dad has said some shocking remarks. When asked about his daughter’s transformation into a boy, the R&B star said to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>WGCI</a>: “You don’t really wanna open it up by saying my daughter is becoming my son, because if that were true… Don’t even give the blogs that kind of credit. You know what I’m saying? Real talk.” Heartbreaking.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>What do YOU think about Jay staying confident even though his dad isn’t being supportive,&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>?
