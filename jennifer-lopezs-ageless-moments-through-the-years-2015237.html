Lo burst onto the scene as a Fly Girl dancer on In Living Color in 1991. After a few seasons on the show, she left to conquer Hollywood. As an actress, Lopez had her first starring hit role in the 1997 biopic Selena, playing legendary Mexican American singer Selena Quintanilla.</p><p>The rest, of course, is history. Lopez went on to star in iconic films including Out of Sight, The Wedding Planner, Maid in Manhattan and Gigli. In 1999, she launched her wildly successful music career with her first album, On the 6, which featured smash singles “If You Had My Love” and “Waiting for Tonight.”</p><p>Soon, the stylish Bronx native became as well known for her rocky romantic life as for her singing, acting and dancing. After her divorce from first husband, <strong>Ojani Noa</strong>, in 1998, she started dating <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Sean “Diddy” Combs</strong></a> (Puff Daddy at the time). A brief marriage to backup dancer <strong>Cris Judd</strong> followed before she and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Ben Affleck</strong></a> became beloved celebrity couple Bennifer — for the first time.</p><p>The future <a href=#>American Idol</a> judge was then wed to <a href=#><strong>Marc Anthony</strong></a> from 2004 to 2011, welcoming twins Max and Emme in February 2008. In 2017, she began dating former New York Yankees player <a href=#><strong>Alex Rodriguez</strong></a>. The pair got engaged in March 2019 but <a href=#>called it quits in April 2021, saying in a statement</a> that they’re “better as friends.”</p><p>Shortly after her split from A-Rod, the “Let’s Get Loud” singer <a href=#>rekindled her romance with Affleck</a>, whom she’d initially dated from 2002 to 2004. In May 2021, the pair were spotted taking a trip to Montana and were later photographed kissing while working out at a gym in Miami.</p><p>“They’re well aware some cynics still look at it as a big flashy attention grab and roll their eyes at the speed of it all, but it doesn’t faze them one iota,” <a href=#>a source told Us Weekly</a> in July 2021. “They’re fully committed to taking the next steps and spending the rest of their lives together.”</p><p>In April 2022, the duo got engaged for the second time, and three months later, <a href=#>they tied the knot in Las Vegas</a>. “We did it. Love is beautiful. Love is kind. And it turns out love is patient. Twenty years patient,” the Hustlers star wrote in a July 2022 edition of her “On the JLo” newsletter. “When love is real, the only thing that matters in marriage is one another and the promise we make to love, care, understand, be patient, loving and good to one another. We had that. And so much more. Best night of our lives.”</p><p>Through all of this, Lopez also became a red carpet darling and designer muse.
