A big wager of $19400," Ken said.</p><p>"Leaving you with $1200, but today that’s enough!”</p><p>Devin was declared the new champion with a 1-day amount of $1200.</p><p>Ben’s second-place consolation prize was $2000, and Deb was given a third-place consolation prize of $1000.</p><p>As the players congratulated each other and their final earnings showed, Devin had less money than Ben's $2000 despite winning.</p><h2>'FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN THAT!'</h2><p>Viewers went absolutely haywire on social media over the <a href=#>triple stumper</a> and ensuing chump change scores.</p><p>One fan wrote under a YouTube clip: "Wow, small win on Jeopardy! today. Lowest score. Unbelievable."</p><p>Another wrote: "First time I saw that in a long freaking time."</p><p>"Second place made more than the winner," wrote a third person as a fourth replied: "LOL. That’s right!"</p><p>A fifth fan on Reddit wrote: "That was some poor Final Jeopardy wagering," as another said: "Some risky wagers that didn't quite pan out."</p><p>A sixth wrote: "Deb could've wagered at most 9,999 and Devin could have gone significantly shorter"</p><p>Another agreed that even though it made for a memorable moment, the players all overbet, especially Deb from second place.</p><p>"I feel like both Deb and Ben bet sub-optimally. Deb should have bet just enough to get $1 over Devin's score and Ben should have just bet $0 since it likely wouldn't have changed anything anyways. Had either of them done that, Devin wouldn't have won."</p><p>On Twitter, someone wrote: “Man, what was the lowest amount someone won with? $1,200 is the lowest I’ve seen in a while.”</p><p>“Ok how did NO ONE get final jeopardy, I had to read that poem multiple times throughout grade school and high school. it’s like one of her most famous poems!!!!</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>This is the second odd technicality of the week as on Monday, the <a href=#>game show</a>&nbsp;presented three new contestants and no returning champion.</p><p><a href=#>Three-day champ Ben Chan</a>&nbsp;abruptly exited after<a href=#>&nbsp;having contracted COVID-19</a>.
