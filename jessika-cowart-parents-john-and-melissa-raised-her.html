Jessika is not the only athletic child of the family as her brother, Sam looks to make a name for himself in football.</strong></p><p>It’s with no doubt we can say that growing up, Jessika and Sam fought, which sport is actually called football. But with their dad being a fan of the 49ers, we think we know who might’ve won the argument.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jessika-cowart-mother.jpg><p>Nonetheless, the California native Jessika Cowart received the full support of her parents to pursue her soccer dreams. The US-born soccer player represents the Philippines Women’s Team, at the international level through her mother’s side family.</p><p>With teammates <a href=# rel=noopener>Carleigh Frilles</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Olivia McDaniel</a>, Jessika Cowart, is part of the Philippines squad competing in the Women’s World Cup. The defender played 85 minutes as the Philippines emerged victorious against the host nation New Zealand.</p><h2>Jessika Cowart Parents, John, And Melissa</h2><p>Jessika Cowart’s parents, John and Melissa Cowart, come from a military background. The couple raised three kids in Fairfield, California.&nbsp;</p><p>The soccer player’s father, John Cowart, previously served in the US Army. After retiring from the Army, the father of three joined the police force and in 2012, was even voted Officer of the Year and also earned Outstanding Duty Award.&nbsp;</p><p>Melissa Cowart comes from a Philipino background, but just like John served in the US military. Melissa is a retired US Navy veteran, with John revealing the fact through his <a href=# rel=noopener>Facebook handle</a> last year on Veteran’s Day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jessika-cowart-family.jpg><p>John comes from a household with a police background, with his father, Greg Cowart, serving in the police to this date. He even shared an accomplishment of his father winning the CHPD Team Member of The Month in August 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>On her Instagram, in 2018, Jessika <a href=# rel=noopener>shared a video</a> of surprising her dad on the day of his last briefing. The father-daughter duo hugged for several seconds as they tried to calm down their nerves on an emotional day.&nbsp;</p><p>Along with sharing pictures of his military life, John also shares the individual achievements of his three kids. Recently, he shared Jessika’s pictures from the victory over New Zealand on his handle and has previously shared photos from various matches.</p><p>Melissa and John seem to be into sports and support the teams based in San Francisco. If Melissa seems to be a huge supporter of the Golden State Warriors and <a href=# rel=noopener>Stephen Curry</a>, then John is a fan of the San Francisco 49ers.&nbsp;</p><h2>Jessika Cowart Siblings</h2><p>Jessika Cowart grew up alongside two siblings, Jenna Cowart Cortez and Sam Cowart. The soccer player seems to be the family’s middle child, with Jenna being the older married sibling.</p><p>Jenna Cowart Cortez graduated from Austin Peay State University and is married to Julio Cortez. The couple tied the knot in 2019 and became parents for the first time last year in August.&nbsp;</p><p>Like his father-in-law, Julio too serves in the US Army. Earlier this year, in March, John shared an appreciation post for his son-in-law on his birthday for trying his best to perfect the role of a soldier and a dad.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jessika-cowart-siblings.jpg><p>Jessika’s little brother, Sam Cowart, was born on December 10, 2006, and is a linebacker at his high school. Earlier this year, John and Melissa enrolled their son in Five Star Linemen Academy to enhance his football skills.</p><p>In the gallery of images shared by John and a video as well, the police officer wrote even NFL players trained with Five Star Linemen Academy. So, there is a chance we might one day see a Cowart on an NFL team. John would certainly love it if it’s the 49ers.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC2xKyqoqORYrCww8Crq2aokaeyr8DSZqGooJ5irq%2BwjKacpaGjqK5uvsCiqp6cXZ2ys3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
