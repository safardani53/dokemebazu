outside of a house in Eastern Shore, <a href=#>Maryland</a> on Wednesday, but declined to speak.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000617190744.jpg><p>The reporter shouted at the presidential hopeful's brother saying she wanted to "ask him about the China deal."</p><p>"Would you please stop bothering me," Jim responded.</p><p>He was then asked whether he would like to comment, to which he responded "I don't want to comment about anything to you."</p><p>The man did not answer when the journalist asked if he was Jim Biden, but two sources confirmed it was him, according to the outlet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

this month, Joe Biden’s son was in talks with the&nbsp;<a href=#>Shanghai-based</a>&nbsp;conglomerate CEFC&nbsp;<a href=#>China</a>&nbsp;Energy Co, <a href=#>with one message detailing “remuneration packages”</a> for six people involved in the deal.</p><p>The emails were from a hard drive obtained by the New York Post allegedly belonging to Hunter Biden.</p><p><a href=#>The Sun</a> cannot independently confirm the authenticity of these documents.</p><p>One email sent on May 13 had the subject line "expectations," and identified Hunter as "Chair / Vice Chair depending on agreement with CEFC."</p><p>Hunter's pay was revealed as "850," and 80 percent of the company’s "equity" was to be split equally among four people, one of them being "H."</p><p>The email also listed “10 Jim" and "10 held by H for the big guy?"&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000617191039.jpg><p>Jim and the “big guy” were not identified in the messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The alleged sender of the email, James Gilliar of the international consulting firm J2cR, wrote "I am happy to raise any detail with Zang if there is [sic] shortfalls?"</p><p>The Post reported that "Zang" is an apparent reference to Zang Jian Jun, who is the former executive director of CEFC China.</p><p>In an email from August 2, 2017, Hunter mentioned a deal he struck with former CEFC chairman Ye Jianming for half-ownership of a holding company that was expected to provide Hunter with more than $10million a year.</p><img

was taken into custody by Chinese authorities in 2018 and has not been seen since.</p><p>CEFC also went bankrupt earlier this year, the Post reports.</p><p>Hunter also said in an alleged email that a former three-year consulting deal that was set to pay him "for introductions alone" had since been changed.</p><p>"The chairman changed that deal after we me[t] in&nbsp;<a href=#>MIAMI</a>&nbsp;TO A MUCH MORE LASTING AND LUCRATIVE ARRANGEMENT to create a holding company 50% percent [sic] owned by ME and 50% owned by him," Hunter allegedly wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000555758628-38.jpg><p>"Consulting fees is one piece of our income stream but the reason this proposal by the chairman was so much more interesting to me and my family is that we would also be partners inn [sic] the equity and profits of the JV’s [joint venture’s] investments."</p><p>A photo, dated August 1 2017, of a handwritten flowchart of the ownership of "Hudson West" shows an equal split between Hunter and someone identified as "Chairman."</p><p>A report of Hunter's overseas business dealings showed that a company called Hudson West III reportedly opened a line of credit in September 2017, Senators Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley revealed last month.</p><p>The credit cards tied to the account were used by Hunter, his uncle James Biden and James' wife, Sara Biden, to purchase more than $100,000 "worth of extravagant items, including airline tickets and multiple items at Apple Inc. stores, pharmacies, hotels and restaurants," according to the report.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

One of two owners was reportedly Hunter Biden's law firm, Owasco PC, the Post reported.</p><p>Biden's August email was sent to Gongwen Dong who has been identified as CFO of the Kam Fei Group, which is an investment firm based in&nbsp;<a href=#>Hong Kong</a>.</p><p>Alongside the emails, documents obtained by the Post included an "Attorney Engagement Letter" executed in September 2017 in which one of Ye's top lieutenants, former Hong Kong government official Chi Ping Patrick Ho, agreed to pay Biden a $1million retainer for "Counsel to matters related to US law and advice pertaining to the hiring and legal analysis of any US Law Firm or Lawyer."</p><p>Ho was convicted in December 2018 in two schemes to pay $3million in bribes to high-ranking government officials in&nbsp;<a href=#>Africa</a>&nbsp;for oil rights in Chad and lucrative business deals in Uganda. He served a three-year jail sentence and was deported to Hong Kong in June.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000614471333-1.jpg><p>Hunter's lawyer, George Mesires, previously told the Post: "There is no need for comment on any so-called information provided by&nbsp;<a href=#>Rudy Giuliani</a>.</p><p>"He has been pushing widely discredited conspiracy theories about the Biden family, openly relying on actors tied to Russian intelligence. His record of dishonesty in these matters speaks for itself."</p><p>Giuliani was the source that shared a copy of the laptop's contents with the Post, it was reported.</p><p>The former&nbsp;<a href=#>New York</a>&nbsp;Mayor speculated that the Chinese government may have obtained non-public emails from Biden's laptop.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News</h2></p><p>Giuliani told former&nbsp;<a href=#>White House</a>&nbsp;chief strategist Steve Bannon on his War Room Pandemic podcast: "I have to tell you – and this is very sensitive. The stuff that we're in possession of contains 1,000 maybe more photographs that are highly, highly anywhere from inappropriate to illegal and have to be possessed by the Chinese government.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"If the Chinese government doesn't have these photographs, they're not really a rival," Giuliani continued. "Everything the American people are going to look at in the next five days, China's been looking at for a long time."</p><p>However, Giuliani did not disclose any photographs and did not provide any evidence that the Chinese government obtained this information.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoBxgZdscGpnmqSybrbIpmShrZ6psrN5waKbnqZdoa6xwM6pZJygmaOubrDEmqOsZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
