When it came to his love life, Daly had no luck either.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>He’s been married and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">divorced</a> four times. Currently, the 55-year-old has plans of fifth marriage with his fiancée, Anna Cladakis.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Fifth Time’s the Charm</h2><p>Daly first <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">met</a> Cladakis in 2007 while she was doing PR for Hooters during his separation from his fourth wife. She was working as a promotional director at Hooters, and since meeting Cladakis, Daly seems to have been at ease with his life.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>The pair took things slowly and got engaged in 2014. Daly got healthier and changed his ways, all thanks to Cladakis, who has been praised for taming golf’s former “Wild Thing.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with Corey McKernan, the golfer beamed about her positive impact on him. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He gushes about how she is one of the most supportive human beings in his life and helps him in every sense, like dealing with his sponsors and setting up his zoom interviews.</p><p>The interviewer then asked him if a younger Daly would have listened to her.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>That’s a good question. But I think I would because of the support. No other woman tried to help me like Anna.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The couple does not share any children although both of them have children from previous marriages.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Stormy Marriages</h2><p>Daly’s first marriage was in 1987 with ex-wife Dale Crafton, a hand model from Arkansas. The couple moved to Crafton’s hometown of Blytheville, Arkansas, to spend their new lives but found himself bored and unhappy in the small town.</p><p>It got too much, and two years later, they got divorced.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Just two months after the divorce, Daly met his second wife, Bettye Fulford, and their relationship was riddled with controversies from the start. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>He found out that Fulford was 10 years older than he thought and that she had a 13-year-old son, which resulted in a breakup. However, they made amends and got married in 1992.</p><p>Soon thereafter, Fulford gave birth to Daly’s daughter, Shynah Hale. The marriage did not last long after assault allegations surfaced, and they finally divorced in 1995.</p><p>Daly’s third marriage was to a woman named Paulette Doan, whom he had briefly dated while he was on a break from with his second wife.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Once his divorce with Fulford was finalized, Daly and Dean got back together and married. With Dean, Daly had another daughter Sierra Lynn.</p><p>The marriage was as tumultuous as those that preceded it, and after four years, they divorced.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Daly’s subsequent marriage was with Memphis native Sherrie Miller. The duo got married and gave birth to Daly’s first and only son, John Patrick Daly II.</p><p>However, in 2007, their marriage soured when the couple got in a fight at a restaurant, and they&nbsp;divorced in 2010. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>His failed marriages did not stop the pro golfer from finding love, and he finally found it with Cladakis.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnmqS1r3nDmqOyZaees6Z5wqGgpZyimrtvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
