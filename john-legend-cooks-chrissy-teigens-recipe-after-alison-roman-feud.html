And then it was like: Boom, line at Target. Boom, now she has an Instagram page that has over a million followers where it’s just, like, people running a content farm for her. That horrifies me and it’s not something that I ever want to do. I don’t aspire to that.”</p><p>When the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit&nbsp;model learned of Roman’s remarks, she opened up about how hurtful and inaccurate they were. “This is a huge bummer and hit me hard,” she admitted via Twitter on Friday, May 8. “I have made her recipes for years now, bought the cookbooks, supported her on social and praised her in interviews. I don’t think I’ve ever been so bummed out by the words of a fellow food-lover. I just had no idea I was perceived that way, by her especially.”</p><p>Though Roman ultimately apologized to Teigen for her “<a href=#>flippant</a>” and “careless” comments, the drama surrounding their disagreement led the Chrissy’s Court host to announce on Sunday that she was taking a “<a href=#>break</a>” from Twitter because she was tired of dealing with the backlash.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Alison-Roman.jpg><p>“I really hate what this drama has caused this week,” she tweeted before listing some of the nasty messages she has received from trolls in recent days. “Calling my kids Petri dish babies or making up flight manifests with my name on them to ‘Epstein island’, to justify someone else’s disdain with me seems gross to me so I’m gonna take a little break.” Her account is now private.</p><p>Despite her current absence from Twitter, Teigen remains active on other social media platforms, such as Instagram. She is also still creating content for her Cravings website, which Roman called part of a “content farm.”</p><p>On Sunday, for example, the Utah native published a new video featuring herself, Legend and Luna <a href=#>making chocolate balloon bowls together</a>. Though fun in theory, Teigen readily admitted that the culinary experiment wasn’t as easy as it looked, seeing as the balloons kept popping when they came in contact with the warm chocolate.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Chocolate balloon bowls … did not go as planned,” she quipped in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram caption</a> featuring a video of the family activity.</p><p>“Oh my god, it’s such a mess. I swear this works,” she declared in the clip before getting one balloon to stay inflated long enough to create an edible dish.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZqOnmKN6rbHGnqWdZZOkvKy%2FjJyfq6GjqMZuwMSinp6mo2K%2Fpq%2FIqZxmmZapsrN5wKWgrKeeYr%2BwucCnZJ%2BdpZl8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
