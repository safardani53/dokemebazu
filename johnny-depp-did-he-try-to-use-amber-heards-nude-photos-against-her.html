Unfortunately for me, I remember them in full, in full detail, everything that happened,” the assistant continued.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/johnny-depp-enters-court-1-1024x696.jpg><p>“He was appalled, when I told him he kicked you, he cried.”</p><p>“Once again, I find myself in a place of shame and regret. Of course I am sorry…I will never do it again…My illness somehow crept up and grabbed me…I feel so bad for letting you down,” Depp later texted Heard.</p><p>Another surprising revelation was the news that Heard’s lawyers begged her to reconsider her decision to walk away from “tens of millions of dollars” during her divorce from Depp.</p><p>It seems that Depp shot the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean movie during their marriage, meaning that the money he earned — a cool $33 million — was considered a “community property asset.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/amber-heard-at-trial-1024x683.jpg><p>In an email to their client, Heard’s lawyers wrote that she was being “amazingly true to your word, that this is not about the money.”</p><p>Those exchanges were also rejected as evidence, as the judge refused to allow the inclusion of any documentation regarding Depp and Heard’s divorce, deeming it irrelevant to the defamation case.</p><p>Depp’s lawyers also requested that the judge exclude any “references to and evidence regarding Marilyn Manson” because they argued it would “smear Mr. Depp under a guilty by association theory.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/02/marilyn-manson-on-the-red-carpet-1024x717.jpg><p><a href=#>Manson has faced abuse allegations</a> from actress Evan Rachel Wood, as well as several other exes.</p><p>Depp’s team also asked the judge to exclude Heard’s claims that the actor suffers from erectile dysfunction.</p><p>Lawyers for claimed that the allegation was relevant to Mr. Depp’s use of a bottle to “sexually assault Heard, which was one of the allegations in the trial.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/johnny-depp-testifies-1024x699.jpg><p>They wrote that the condition “might somehow be a motivation for abuse.”</p><p>In the end, that specific allegation was not allowed, but Heard did claim on the stand that <a href=#>Depp sexually assaulted her with a glass bottle</a>.</p><p>In the end, of course, Depp won the case and was awarded an eight-figure settlement.</p><p>But it remains to be seen if Hollywood will deem the actor unemployable following round after round of shocking allegations.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WFcLbOoaWnsV2ZsrG8jJ2gnWWYmnq1vthmq6hlpaiybq3Mm5yrZZiarrOw0malrpyVYr2pu9OoqmaZl5a2r7%2FTZp%2Beql8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
