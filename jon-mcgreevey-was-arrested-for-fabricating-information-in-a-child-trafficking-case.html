However, the subsequent inquiry revealed that there was no evidence to back up the assertion. There were no witnesses to the alleged conduct, and the detectives assigned to the Harford County Youngster Advocacy Center identified the adult man and the child in the issue. Deputies claim that:</p><p>“Detectives interviewed witnesses, investigated leads, obtained digital evidence, and identified the adult man and adolescent girl named in the first complaint. According to the inquiry, no sex acts were done or offered by any of the persons in the facility as stated by White.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Jon-McGreevey-1.png alt="Jon McGreevey" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>A week before his arrest, on July 7, McGreevey was interrogated by investigators.
