critics of the family are doing their best to ensure that Jim Bob won’t be able to rebuild his empire this time, as he has on so many other occasions.</p><p>Last week, <a href=#>Josh Duggar was arrested on child pornography charges</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>At a bail hearing held on Wednesday, Josh was released to the home of Jim Bob’s friends.</p><p>He is not permitted to live in any home where he would be under the same roof as minors.</p><p>Josh must now be monitored, with violations of his bond reported to the court.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>News of this arrangement came on the heels of Josh’s wife, Anna Duggar, defending her husband’s actions.</p><p>She is in denial — insiders claim — even going so far as to insist that <a href=#>Josh was set up by President Biden</a>.</p><p>People can convince themselves of just about anything if they want to badly enough.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>So his family is not shy about the fact that they’re still protecting him.</p><p>And there’s a good chance that they believe his ridiculous story.</p><p>At least some of them seem to buy that a rogue employee uploaded the illegal content in order to frame him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>This means that whether he appears on the show or not …</p><p>… Josh will continue to benefit from the production of new episodes of Counting On.</p><p>And that’s just one of many reasons that the TLC reality show needs to come to an end.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Amazingly, despite the gravity of the situation in which the network now finds itself, <a href=#>TLC has not canceled Counting On</a>.</p><p>And there’s no reason to believe that they intend to do so.</p><p>After all, if the network were going to cut ties with the Duggars for covering for Josh, they’d have done so in 2015.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>A movement of concerned fans hopes to change TLC’s tune.</p><p>At this point, nearly 18,000 people have signed a Change.org petition.</p><p>The petition urges the network not only to cancel the series, but to "Delete All Duggar Shows."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>In other words, to remove both Counting On and its predecessor, 19 Kids and Counting, from all platforms.</p><p>This would also include streaming services.</p><p>All that would be left would be home media collections and, of course, pirated video collections.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"The Duggar family should no longer have a platform," the petition begins.</p><p>"Josh Duggar molested his sisters," it grimly notes.</p><p>"And as of April 29, 2021 he has been arrested (by federal authorities) for child pornography," it continues.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"This family should no longer be allowed to collect money from streaming services and television series," the petition declares.</p><p>"Enough is enough," the petition writers express.</p><p>The petition reasons: "Too many people have been harmed."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>It’s nearly impossible to argue against those observations.</p><p>And yet currently, there’s been no movement on TLC’s end.</p><p>As the petition grows in strength, there is hope that this will change.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Cutting ties with Josh is not enough at this point.</p><p>The reason for that is allowing Counting On to continue would mean further enriching Jim Bob and his family.</p><p>These are the very people who have sheltered and defended a known sexual predator.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>On Twitter, critics are going even further and calling for a boycott of all TLC shows.</p><p>This would include the wildly popular 90 Day Fiance franchise.</p><p>The goal is to apply real financial pressure to force the network to do the right thing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"The fact that @tlc is keeping @duggarfam on the air after Josh Duggar was charged with possessing 200 photos of CP is just HORRIFYING. #boycottTLC," reads one such tweet.</p><p>The scandal couldn’t have come at a worse time for the network.</p><p>TLC recently launched a new slate of content that can only be accessed via the subscription-based Discovery Plus app.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>TLC placing such a high premium on its content was always a dubious endeavor.</p><p>Many have their doubts enough a sufficiently large customer base will be willing to pay.</p><p>Many consider the content to be essentially basic cable-caliber content.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Now, the network has to contend with questions about whether or not its most basic offerings should be permitted to exist.</p><p>And for reasons that defy explanation, TLC execs are refusing to placate the public by at least canceling Counting On.</p><p>Right now, they can make money off of the Duggars. Fans know that this has to change for TLC to take action.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tpX2WCcLbOrJ9mnKWctKK%2BjK2fqK2jlrulv4ysoKCmXaWytbXToqanZaWntKq6xmarpZtdqbxur8Cnmp6kXZi8trrToqVo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
