Rafferty is a product of Jude’s marriage to his first wife, actress and fashion designer <strong>Sadie Frost</strong>, whom he met on the set of the 1994 movie Shopping. Rafferty has followed in his dad’s footsteps, acting in various short films and shooting for an upcoming remake of Oliver Twist. He’s also a DJ and musician with the band Outer Stella Overdrive and has walked in shows for high-end fashion designers Dolce & Gabanna and Dior. The 25-year-old is also set to appear in The Hat, aka a short film he and dad Jude shot on an iPhone during the pandemic which is set to release in November,&nbsp;reported&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Elle</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Also like his father, Rafferty has quite the love life, recently linked to pop star <strong>Rita Ora</strong>, although the couple broke up in early 2020. He is now reportedly seeing&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Brooklyn Beckham</strong></a>‘s ex-girlfriend,&nbsp;model&nbsp;<strong>Hana Cross</strong>, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mama Mia</a>.</p><h2><strong><strong><strong>Iris Law</strong></strong></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jude-Law-Family-embed-11.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Also a product of Jude and Sadie’s marriage is Iris, born October 25, 2000. Iris is a successful model in the fashion industry, walking the runways for various brands like Miu Miu and Burberry and landing on the pages of Vogue. The 20-year-old also isn’t afraid to show off her killer beach bod on her Instagram, sharing various <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>bikini shots</a> over the summer to her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>social media page</a>.</p><h2><strong><strong><strong>Rudy Law&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jude-Law-Family-embed-31.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Rudy was born on September 10, 2002, and is Jude’s youngest child with first wife Sadie. Compared to his older siblings, Rudy keeps things relatively low key, not showing much on social media or taking up modeling like his older brother and sister. Rudy did star in a the 2013 short film&nbsp;Dottie&nbsp;with mom Sadie, however he hasn’t shown any interest in acting since.</p><h2><strong><strong><strong>Sophia Law&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Born in September 2009, Sophia is the only child Jude shares with American model&nbsp;<strong>Samantha Burke</strong>. Jude met Samantha in New York City while he was filming&nbsp;Sherlock Holmes&nbsp;and the two never officially dated. Although the&nbsp;Talented Mr. Ripley&nbsp;actor was skeptical at first about his being the actual father, reported&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Telegraph</a>, he still supports Sophia financially. She and her mother live in Florida and Jude <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>doesn’t see them often</a>, but friends say the 12-year-old greatly resembles her father.</p><h2><strong><strong><strong>Ada Law&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>Ada, who was born in March 2015, is Jude’s only child with singer-songwriter <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Catherine Harding</strong></a>. The couple was only together for a short time, with Ada’s arrival coming after their separation. Even so, Catherine told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Mirror</a>&nbsp;at the time that Jude is a “great dad” who does well on baby duty. “Jude is really funny and sweet,” she stated. “I remember last week he came over and he had to change her on the park bench. He cleaned her all up.”</p><h2><strong><strong><strong>Baby Law #6</strong></strong></strong></h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Jude <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>confirmed the birth</a> of his first child with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wife</a> <strong>Phillipa</strong> <strong>Coan </strong>on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Tonight Show</a>&nbsp;on Sept. 14, 2020. The Closer&nbsp;star told host&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jimmy Fallon</a>&nbsp;</strong>that the experience around the birth was “unusual” given the pandemic, but that ultimately, things worked out in a “really wonderful” way. “We feel pretty blessed that we when we’re in a time, that … we could just nest and enjoy each other’s company,” he stated on the show. The couple have yet to revealed their bundle of joy’s name.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Reflecting on fatherhood, Jude explained to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Observer</a>&nbsp;in 2016 how he was finding the balance between being a hands-on father and learning when to let go. “<span class=s1>As a friend said, ‘Letting them fall over and not being there to pick them up…it’s really hard.
