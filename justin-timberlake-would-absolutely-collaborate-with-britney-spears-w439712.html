Timberlake, 35, just found out that his ex would be totally down to collaborate — and his reaction was perfect.</p><p>Even more, the “SexyBack” singer accepted her invitation. “She did? Sure! Absolutely, absolutely,” the former boy-bander told <a href=#><i>E! News</i></a> at the Toronto International Film Festival premiere of his concert documentary, <i>Justin Timberlake + The Tennessee Kids</i>, on Tuesday, September 13. Watch his surprised response in the video above!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“I have a 17-month-old, so I don’t get the headline news,” he added of <a href=#>Silas, his son with wife <b>Jessica Biel</b>.</a> “I apologize for not being in the know.”</p><p><a href=#>As previously reported, Spears, 34,</a> said during a fan Q&A session late last month that she’d love to hit the music studio with ex-boyfriend Timberlake. “Aerosmith [frontman <b>Steven Tyler</b>] seems really good and bright. He’s a genius, I think. He’s very rock ’n’ roll. He sings from his soul. <b>Gwen Stefani</b>, I think she’s great,” she said on August 27. “Justin Timberlake is very good.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><span>Timberlake appeared completely shocked by Spears’ remarks. “I’m accessible,” he said on Tuesday, staring right into the camera. “Give us a call!”</span></p><p><a href=#>Timberlake and the “Clumsy” singer,</a> of course, dated from 1999 to 2002, years after meeting on set of <i>The All New Mickey Mouse Club</i>. Timberlake was Spears’ first kiss and he later hinted in an interview that she lost his virginity to him.</p><p>The pop royalty by no means ended their relationship on good terms. The two split amid rumors that Spears cheated on him. Timberlake went on to write “Cry Me a River” and “What Goes Around … Comes Around,” which have been rumored to be about her.</p><p>Nevertheless, Timberlake has nothing but respect for her. Back in 2007, he opened up about Spears during an interview with <b>Oprah Winfrey</b>. At the time, Spears was going through a headline-making breakdown. “I haven’t spoken to her in years. There’s no ill will. I have nothing but love for her,” he said. “We were teenagers, and I think that’s basically the best way to describe what happened to us. I think she’s a great person. I don’t know her as well as I did.”</p><p>The pair have both moved on since the split. Timberlake married Biel, 34, in 2012. Spears, who had two failed marriages, is mom of sons Preston, 11, and Jayden, 10, with ex-husband <b>Kevin Federline</b>.</p><p>Relive some of Timberlake and Spears’ cutest moments in the video above!</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGuq6Seu27AyKaZnqqclrimedaorKWcXZavtLvLrquepKlisLC4y5qZqKqRqbJuw8itn2aaop7Br7HYZqqpnZGnwG7Dk2xwcGliZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
