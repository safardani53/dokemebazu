It never happened!"</p><p><span>Kathy Griffin</span> — who also appeared on<span> The View</span> Friday — joked that she'd pay the lad mag to let her pose nude dressed up as Kate.</p><p><a href=#>Check out Kate's high school yearbook photo</a></p><p>"Why don't we do a nude…lesbo thing?" Griffin asked Kate.</p><p>Her response?</p><p>"Oh, wow," Kate said.</p><p>Kate also told Griffin she laughed at a video the comic filmed for Jimmy Kimmel Live. In the clip, Griffin dons a wig, screams at her kids and rolls her eyes as estranged husband Jon — played by Star Trek's George Takei — makes out with a cheerleader.</p><p>"I watched it online and I didn't know what to expect," she said. "I caught myself cracking up out loud.</p><p>Kate — who was back to her wavy 'do — also discussed tabloid reports that <span>Jon</span>&nbsp;slept with a former nanny, Stephanie Santoro, while his kids were home.</p><p>"Well, I guess it's the article of the week and basically my only comment on that — just based on the behavior of the last several months — I'm not surprised," Kate said. "Honestly, I don't know. We were separated. It goes back to the recent police being called, blah blah blah.</p><p>"I need to say about this article, I'm not saying it's true or false," she went on. "All I'm talking about is what my intuition is saying. The background story is I had never met this babysitter." (Us Weekly reported Jon and Santoro — who sold $2 shots at local bar Legends Lounge — had a sexy sleepover in early August.)</p><p>In August, cops were called to the the family's $1.1-million Pennsylvania home after Kate showed up while Jon was supposed to have custody of their eight kids.</p><p>Kate explained: "I learned that he asked this babysitter to come over when he was not going to be home. It started out very friendly. I called him and said, 'If you're not going to be home, can I come?'"</p><p><a href=#>Check out pictures from Jon and Kate's summer</a></p><p>Kate says her "alarms and whistles" were going off about Santoro. "I asked him kindly to use the approved babysitters we have," she said.</p><p>Kate said she "sat at the gate and just sobbed."</p><p><span>Joy Behar</span> pointed out that Kate was "winning the PR award."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Said Kate: I'm not out to win any awards. I'm just out to be the best mother I can possibly be."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKarJVitLC%2F0p6joqZdmbKvtcSsZKyglah6sbvSoqWgZZakv268y5qwm6epYn9xfJhqb3Jn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
