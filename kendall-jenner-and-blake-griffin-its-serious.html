Good for her. She’s one of the hottest people on the planet, and she deserves to have a good time.</p><p>But it looks like she’s settled for a suitor, and things are getting a lot more serious.</p><p>Blake and Kendall have been less than eager to be seen together, but they’ve been hooking up since the summer.</p><p>It’s easy to see why Blake Griffin would be into Kendall Jenner.</p><p>She is almost shockingly gorgeous, even for a supermodel. She’s a world-famous celebrity, even without the modeling.</p><p>In addition to physical appeal, as Kylie’s baby daddy <a href=#>Travis Scott revealed when comparing the sisters</a>, Kendall apparently has a lot of personality in the bedroom.</p><p>It doesn’t take a stretch of the imagination to see why Kendall would be into Blake Griffin, either.</p><p>The basketball player is handsome and has a great body. He’s also an entire foot taller than Kendall — height differences like that can be very appealing.</p><p>And, not for nothing, but Blake is rumored to be packing in the pants department.</p><p>If rumors are to be believed, Blake Griffin “has a Pringles can made of flesh in his shorts.” We are not making up that description. That is a real quote, because the age of social media teaches us so much about the world and every day is an adventure.</p><p>Back in September, Kendall and Blake were reportedly a lot more casual about things.</p><p>According to Us Weekly‘s source, <a href=#>Kendall and Blake’s relationship status</a> has now changed.</p><p>“They’re legit. They’re a full-on couple.”</p><p>The two have been spotted (despite reasonable efforts) out and about together, but that can lead people to drift apart as easily as it can bring them together.</p><p>For Kendall and Blake, clearly it’s been the latter.</p><p>“Kendall has been going to a lot of his games and they have been enjoying time at home when Blake is in town. They’re good.”</p><p>Going to games isn’t generally very subtle, since audiences at basketball games are often in photos — especially when they’re up front.</p><p>But “enjoying time at home” … yeah, we’d imagine so.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>This new level of seriousness sounds like a major shift for the couple.</p><p>Just a couple of weeks ago,&nbsp;People‘s source gave a little more insight into Blake and Kendall’s budding relationship.</p><p>“He is super into her.”</p><p>Clearly, that hasn’t changed.</p><p>“She thinks he’s dorky and funny, but also cool and sexy. She thinks he has a certain attractive ‘swagger.’”</p><p>Awwww, that sounds so sweet!&nbsp;</p><p>“They are seeing each other more and Blake is doing everything in his power to make Kendall his girlfriend, but she is keeping him at arm’s length because she knows how busy she is.”</p><p>We wonder what he managed to do to make her see things his way. Something romantic, we imagine.</p><p>Though we’re sure that Kendall will continue to take her modeling work very seriously.</p><p>“She’s always working and traveling and knows a full-blown relationship isn’t necessarily the best idea, but things are heating up and she is for sure enjoying dating him.”</p><p>Clearly, a lot has changed in the last couple of weeks.</p><p>That can happen with relationships.</p><p>It’s important for there to be more than just a physical connection if a relationship’s going&nbsp;ot&nbsp;turn romantic, and it sounds like they’ve got that.</p><p>But they’re both two stunningly attractive people. That certainly doesn’t hurt.</p><p>We imagine that maybe Blake convinced her that, since he’s busy with his own sportsball career, they can keep up in their long distance relationship without drifting apart or having wandering eyes or whatever.</p><p>We’ll be very interested to see where this relationship takes them. It’s worth noting that <a href=#>Khloe Kardashian’s baby daddy</a> and boyfriend is Tristan Thompson, also a basketball star.</p><p>Hey, it’s about time that the super short Kardashians got some height in their family, right?</p><a href=#><img width=2309 height=1774 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/kendall-jenner-dubbed-fashion-icon-of-the-decade-twitter-loses-i.jpg alt='Kendall Jenner Dubbed "Fashion Icon of the Decade," Twitter Loses Its Mind' decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px" data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=block-title>Kendall Jenner Dubbed “Fashion Icon of the Decade,” Twitter Loses Its Mind</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2Z9cLfEp5uapJxit6a6zZ6pZpmemXqjuMCknGafop6zp7XNZqCtq12osrO1zq6qaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
