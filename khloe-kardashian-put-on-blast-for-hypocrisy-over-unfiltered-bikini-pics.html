And it wasn’t a paparazzi snapshot. It was just a normal, unfiltered pic of her in a bikini at a family party. Khloe’s body image issues have haunted her for many years.</p><p>This week, Khloe posted some drop-dead gorgeous thirst trap photos. Her own sister snapped them. Yes, she’s in a bikini.</p><p>But given Khloe’s past behavior and the tremendous impact that she has upon many of her followers … it’s giving some people serious misgivings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>No one is disputing that Khloe Kardashian looks drop-dead gorgeous in her latest Instagram bikini photos.</p><p>She’s a knockout. That is nothing new. Even when Khloe seems utterly convinced that she isn’t, she’s a total hottie. And, for several years now, she has also been a total MILF.</p><p>Kendall snapped these pics for her, flaunting Khloe’s legendary booty. There was a time when it appeared that Khloe was padding her butt. But that was nearly a year ago. This photo appears unfiltered and as natural as Khloe can be.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Khloe’s body image issues are no secret. And they are not unrelated to her fame.</p><p>When Keeping Up With The Kardashians first debuted, more than a decade and a half ago, it was a period of intense visibiltity and mainstream body-shaming.</p><p>Remember: these days, it’s a scandal when someone body-shames someone. But it was tragically not so long ago when the “scandal” would be having a normal human body with perceived “flaws.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Combared to Kourtney’s conventionally attractive body and the extreme hourglass proportions that Kim flaunts to this day, Khloe’s normal human body made her a target.</p><p>It was the dawn of social media. For the first time, the scathing comments that people “whispered” to friends in online spaces could easily make their way onto the screens of famous people.</p><p>Ever had an actor notice your thirst-tweet or snarky livetweet? Sometimes it’s fun, sometimes it’s awkward. But Khloe saw vile things that clearly left an indelible mark upon her psyche.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>But Khloe has fortunate genetics, a desire to change her body, and the biggest key to any body transformation: virtually unlimited financial resources. Thus, her legendary “revenge body” took shape.</p><p>However, it is extremely obvious from her repeated photoshop scandals and other editing incidents that Khloe has lingering issues. Maybe even trauma.</p><p>Body-image issues aren’t really about your body. They are internal. No matter how hot Khloe is (conventionally or otherwise), she seems to at times struggle to see that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Never has that been more apparent than in April of 2021, when Khloe tried to move heaven and earth to redact one photo from the entire internet. A photo in which she looks normal. Beautiful, even.</p><p>“The color edited photo was taken of Khloe during a private family gathering and posted to social media without permission by mistake by an assistant,” her rep later confirmed.</p><p>“Khloe looks beautiful,” her rep acknowledged. “But it is within the right of the copyright owner to not want an image not intended to be published taken down.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Khloe’s body-image issues, just like her body, are her own. We hope that she can work through them and love and appreciate herself.</p><p>But the impact that this private battle has on fans is worth noting. Because, when you’re doctoring photos that thousands or millions of people see, it’s not really “private.” And no one can honestly question whether a Kardashian influencer influences followers. It’s right there in the name.</p><p>With all of that in mind, we can enjoy Khloe’s unfiltered bikini pics. But … it’s totally fair for them to rub people the wrong way.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2V%2FcLfHpaaeZZuWv6Wt0qGgmqZdpcK1ec6nZJukkajBbrLOq2ShsaCksLO10rJkqK6Vp3q2usWio62dopqxbq7IpKCnoV2ltqS%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
