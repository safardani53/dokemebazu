Oldest move in the book. Good luck girl.”</p><p>In case there was any doubt that he stands by his words, Mr. Rock helpfully signed the tweet, “Kid Rock”.</p><p>It’s anyone’s guess what’s going on in Kid Rock’s head, a place where the top porno flicks of 1993 play on a constant loop behind a haze of thick Marlboro Red smoke, but it seems his comments were inspired by Taylor’s interview in the September issue of Vogue, which dropped on Thursday.</p><p>Swift famously kept mum during the 2016 election, leading some to theorize that she was a secret Trump supporter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/taylor-swift-opens-amas-576x1024.jpg><p>She clarified her stance in the Vogue piece, saying:</p><p>“Unfortunately in the 2016 election you had a political opponent who was weaponizing the idea of the celebrity endorsement.</p><p>“He was going around saying, I’m a man of the people. I’m for you. I care about you.’ I just knew I wasn’t going to help.”</p><p>Recalling the state of her own reputation in 2016, Swift added:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/kid-rock-in-nyc-1024x782.jpg><p>“Also, you know, the summer before that election, all people were saying was, ‘She’s calculated. She’s manipulative. She’s not what she seems. She’s a snake. She’s a liar.’</p><p>“These are the same exact insults people were hurling at Hillary. Would I be an endorsement or would I be a liability? ‘Look, snakes of a feather flock together. Look, the two lying women. The two nasty women.'”</p><p>If Taylor’s remarks contained anything that could be reasonably described as an attack on Trump, it was a very, very mild one.</p><p>But apparently, it was enough to trigger Kid Rock who was so upset that he was unable to stick to politics and felt the need to crudely suggest Taylor exchanges sexual favors for movie roles.</p><p>The tweet is absurd for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that this man-baby has found a way to force the internet to pay attention to him for a few hours.</p><p>On top of that, does Kid really think Taylor has trouble finding work.</p><p>No, even Kid Rock isn’t that stupid — he’s just acting out to try and please he Daddy Donnie.</p><p>As you probably know <a href=#>Rock is a massive Trump supporter </a>and even earned an invite to the White House in 2017.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>His sudden interest in politics is all part of the former Detroit rapper’s effort to rebrand himself as a Southern Good Ol’ Boy.</p><p>It’s shamefully transparent theater, which is why Mr. Rock occasionally needs to ramp up his efforts and go on the offensive.&nbsp;</p><p>Thankfully, most everyone sees this routine for what it is, including Twitter’s own roast queen, Chrissy Teigen:</p><p>“you’re pathetic. – Chrissy Teigen,” she tweeted in imitation of Rock’s hilariously clueless format.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>In the replies, many have pointed out that Teigen is close friends with Kim Kardashian and <a href=#>Kim is still feuding with Taylor</a>.</p><p>That may be true, but some things are bigger than celebrity beefs.</p><p>And roasting Kid Rock for being a dumbass is definitely one of those things.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Taylor Swift is STILL Talking About That Kim Kardashian Feud</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pxX2WFcLfInWSrp5OgeqLA05qapKtdqLm2wIysn5qllah6ta3YpaarZaOstqfAjKKlZpqZr66zvsRmq7Cdlal8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
