But it makes a certain kind of sense.</p><p>In fact, her father was a famous attorney who worked on one of the world’s most infamous criminal cases: the O.J. Simpson trial.</p><p>Now, Kim has divulged that she found her father’s secret library of O.J. evidence as a teen … and poured through the forensics.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Speaking in the May issue of <a href=#>Vogue</a>, Kim Kardashian reflects upon what she remembers of the O.J. Simpson trial.</p><p>Kim was a young teenager at the time and acutely aware of the controversial trial that consumed the attention of a nation.</p><p>And she also knew the role that her father played in it.</p><p>“On the weekends,” Kim divulges. “They used our home as an office.”</p><p>She says that her father, Robert Kardashian, would work there “with Johnnie Cochran and Bob Shapiro.”</p><p>Those are the two biggest names on the infamous “Dream Team” that helped an alleged double-murderer evade justice.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“My dad had a library,” Kim recalls.</p><p>She then details a unique and secret feature of the room that helped him as an attorney.</p><p>“And,” Kim reveals. “When you pushed on this wall there was this whole hidden closet room.”</p><p>That is a neat feature — but more importantly, a useful tool if you’re working on the trial of the century and fear that someone may snoop.</p><p>Kim notes that her father made good use of the hidden closet, stocking it “with all of his O.J. evidence books.”</p><p>Kim knew about the secret chamber, and reveals that her teenage curiosity drove her to investigate the closely guarded secrets.</p><p>“On weekends,” Kim shares. “I would always snoop and look through” the evidence books.</p><p>She says that one aspect of the case in particular really fascinated her.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was really nosy about the forensics,” Kim admits.</p><p>Forensics are circumstantial evidence, and played a central role in the O.J. Simpson trial.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/taking-a-call.jpg><p>it makes a lot of sense that having a famous attorney as a father might inspire one of four children to study the law.</p><p>Considering how closely linked the entire family was to the O.J. Simpson trial, that would have made a tremendous impression upon Kim.</p><p>But there’s more to Kim’s interest in the law than “daddy issues” or formative experiences from her adolescence.</p><p>She has also taken up political activisim in recent years, even braving the Trump-occupied Oval Office to successfully get a grandmother out of prison.</p><p>Whatever you may think of Kim or her family, she’s changing lives.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>A lot about DNA has yet to be fully understood, but sufficie it to say that legal training is not hereditary.</p><p>Kim will have to seriously work over the next few years if she intends to meet her goal of taking and passing the Bar exam in 2022.</p><p>She has four children and an extensive career as a reality star and a businesswoman.</p><p>But she’s also, and we say this as a compliment, a little nuts.</p><p>Like Kris and, to some degree, Khloe, Kim feels extremely driven to constantly do things and to have a packed schedule.</p><p>She also has the resources to make sure that her children want for nothing while she applies herself to her studies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Here’s our question: what is Kim’s endgame for this?</p><p>She could become an attorney but, at the moment, she can do more good by hiring a team of attorneys to do her bidding on someone’s behalf.</p><p>Part of this may just be a desire to remind the world that she’s actually smart.</p><p>(She really, truly is fiercely intelligent — there is no doubt in my mind that she can pass the Bar)</p><p>But is it possible that Kim is considering a future political career?</p><p>Studying the law may just be a stepping stone to passing laws … and Kim may ultimately pursue even higher office.</p><p>She wouldn’t be our first reality star President, but she could be the first who’s smart and arguably not evil.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Keeping Up with the Kardashians Rekap: Kimye at a Krossroads</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pxX2WBcLfIpmSkmaKZrrS0yJqlZqFdqK64ecClo2anlmLBqbGMrJycqpWperC2jKygpqijpLtuwNGimKVllau2pbHNnJxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
