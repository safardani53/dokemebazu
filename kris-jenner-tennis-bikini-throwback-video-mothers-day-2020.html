The momager’s daughter,&nbsp;<strong>Kendall Jenner</strong>, took to Instagram on May 10 to pay tribute to her for Mother’s Day. Kendall decided to post a throwback video of Kris, where she’s showing off her bikini body while practicing her tennis game. Kris wore sneakers with the two-piece swimsuit in the video as she calmly hit tennis balls across the net. “Love your mother,” Kendall captioned the video. She also posted several more photos of Kris on her Instagram Story to further honor her mom.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Kendall wasn’t the only KarJenner kid to reminisce on Kris in her younger years, though. On May 8,&nbsp;<strong>Kim Kardashian</strong> posted an early Mother’s Day message to her mom, and shared yet <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>another bikini pic</a> of her. The photo was taken shortly after Kris gave birth to her fourth child,&nbsp;<strong>Rob Kardashian</strong>, in March 1987. Kim noted that Kris was “MAJOR GOALS” in the photo. She also revealed that, for Kris’s Mother’s Day present, she contacted the photographer from the 64-year-old’s wedding to&nbsp;<strong>Robert Kardashian</strong> and purchased the camera he used to take their wedding photos.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong> also paid tribute to Kris by posting two throwback photos of them together on her Instagram with a heart emoji as the caption.&nbsp;<strong>Khloe Kardashian</strong> posted a series of photos with Kris on her Instagram Story, and gushed that her mom is her “inspiration,” and&nbsp;<strong>Kylie Jenner</strong> shared yet another throwback pic of Kris with the caption, “A Legend.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Meanwhile, Kris <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>honored her own mom</a>, <strong>MJ Shannon</strong>, 85, on the special holiday, as well. “Thank you for teaching me to be the best mother I can be, through the lessons you instilled in me as a mother, friend and mentor,” Kris wrote. “I could not have asked for a more amazing mother and I love you so much.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH12e5BqZqSqmah6q7HNp5yrZaSau6%2B10maZoqOZo7ZuwMerprCakZi4bsLInZyoZZ2kwamx0axknZmpYn9xfo9o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
