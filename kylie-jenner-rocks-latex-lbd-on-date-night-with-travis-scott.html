The Kardashians star, 25, stunned in a skintight, thigh-high mini dress that was cinched at the hip with a longer piece of fabric that slid down one leg. She paired the latex fit with knee-high black stiletto boots and coordinated the look with dark nails.</p><p>The “Sicko Mode” rapper, 31, complemented his partner’s style with fitted black pants and a charcoal-colored jacket with a black tee underneath emblazoned with a white design on the front. While Jenner opted to go out sans jewelry, Scott wore a silver chain around his neck. The pair, who held hands as they walked to the restaurant, also sported matching blackout sunnies.</p><p>The Keeping Up With the Kardashians alum gave birth to <a href=#>the couple’s second child</a> in February, announcing they named him Wolf before quickly <a href=#>deciding to change his moniker</a> to a name they have not yet revealed.</p><p>“We really didn’t have a name. We thought it was going to come to us when we saw him and it didn’t,” the Kylie Cosmetics founder explained in a September episode of The Kardashians. “Then 24 hours before we had to sign the birth certificate — or else they register him without a name — so I felt the pressure to choose a name. <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a> suggested Wolf and I liked the WW.” (Scott’s real name is Jacques Webster, and both of their children have his last name.)</p><p>Jenner admitted, “So we put Wolf Webster in that moment and right after I signed the birth certificate I was like, ‘What did I just do?’”</p><p>Despite the pressure she faced when it came to naming their little one, the California native felt much more prepared — and in the moment — this time around.</p><p>“I feel like with my second [child], you just anticipate everything and you know what’s going to happen because you’ve done it before,” she shared on the show. “I feel like I was a lot more present this time.”</p><p>Jenner also got candid about <a href=#>her postpartum struggles</a>, revealing in a May TikTok that she had previously been dealing with some difficult emotions following her son’s birth.</p><p>“When your postpartum hormones start to level out 😅😅😃,” she captioned the video of herself lip-syncing to audio from an old episode of Life of Kylie.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Dude, I’m getting my personality back though. Like, I’m feeling like myself again,” she mouthed in the TikTok clip. “I really was not myself.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see photos from Jenner and Scott’s night out on the town:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvKsqOinV2fsq%2B6xKtkq6eToMBuuMCtnLFlnJexbrvNZpuarJViu6qzx61ksKGknXq1vsCvoKxlo5i8tcCO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
