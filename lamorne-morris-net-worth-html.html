For some, The Black Panther actor is a source of inspiration, and for others, he is a superhero they can relate to. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>For Morris, however, he was a mentor and a brother.

I want to say we've known each other since 2005, maybe 2006. Right around the time I moved to New York or a little bit before that. We became buddies through another actor, Ramses Jimenez.</p><p>He also revealed that Boseman&nbsp;coached him for his auditions for New Girl, a project that defined and set his career tone. The late actor&nbsp;also helped him through some tough times when he moved to LA. He&nbsp;brought one of his friends to live with Morris to have an easier time paying rent. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Morris probably got the best acting advice of his life from Boseman when he was auditioning for Selma. He recalls Boseman as being an intense guy when it came to the craft of acting.</p><p>He was such an intense guy when it came to his craft. I remember having an audition for Selma, and I asked him to coach me on it. And he came by, and at the time, I was trying to infuse humor in moments that I didn't need to infuse humor into.</p><p>And when he used humor, Boseman advised him to quit joking if he really wanted to get the role and work harder. He taught him to take his auditions seriously and move forward with an intense work ethic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6GurrvRp5xmpZ%2Bnv6q%2FjKecrWWnpL%2B1tI2hq6ak</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
