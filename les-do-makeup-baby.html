But, he didn't follow her back right away, but they would like each other's photos.</p><p>She said that she hated the idea of getting rejected, so she never would DM guys she was interested in. The two eventually began messaging on Twitter, and they bonded over being from El Paso. Alex rarely went back home, and when he did he would only want to spend time with his family. Les Do Makeup was convinced that he was catfishing her.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>When he picked her up&nbsp;for their first date, Leslie tried to break the ice by saying he looked like a catfish.
