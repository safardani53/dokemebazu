So it was really fun to explore that with her because we’re definitely reflections of each other at different ages. That was really fun. It’s been amazing to work with her so far in that capacity.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The show follows the intertwined fates of the picture-perfect Richardson family and a mysterious mother and daughter who upend their lives. Jade&nbsp;added that the show “definitely holds true to those very core beliefs of the book, but it is a TV series, and we have more time to explore. So we are exploring more options, and we get to dive in a little deeper to these characters that Celeste Ng wrote so beautifully.” Little Fires Everywhere will consist of 8 episodes.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>She also teased: “Fans can expect a lot of tension and a lot of very important topics coming into play. There’s a lot of drama, a lot of mystery. And I think that there’s a lot of people who are being represented in this, and I think that, whoever you are, you’ll definitely identify with someone on the show. And I think that people will be excited about that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In addition to Reese, Jade gets to work with Scandal star <strong>Kerry Washington</strong>, 42, who plays Mia Warren. Reese and Kerry, who serve as executive producers on the series, are both inspirations to Jade. “I’ve learned so much from them [Reese and Kerry],” Jade continued. “They are incredible women and incredible artists. I think one thing I learned from both of them is that being a leader means being kind to others and that there’s a lot of strength in supporting other artists in any way you can, and I think they just reiterated that for me. And they’re at the top. They’re amazing producers and amazing actresses, and they’re doing both, and they’re only raising other people up at the same time. They create this atmosphere on set that’s so easy to live and exist in.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH15e5BtZqWhpKm5pnnFoqmeq12aw6a%2B2LCfnqqVYreisMRmp56spK63sLTNZqmenaOaeri106Gcq6ugpLyvecinq56qpp6yuHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
