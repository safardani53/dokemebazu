Hahaha,” the Extra host wrote on Friday, November 10, alongside a photo of Thompson’s comment.</p><p>Several fans online shared Lopez’s opinion, with <a href=# rel=noopener>one fan</a> calling out Thompson for “saying ‘when i cheat’ like it’s a normal thing.” Another X user, meanwhile, <a href=# rel=noopener>wrote</a>, “Just don’t cheat? 🙄.” (Lopez, for his part, <a href=#>admitted to cheating</a> on ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Ali Landry</strong></a> before their 2004 wedding. He’s been married to <a href=#><strong>Courtney Lopez</strong></a> since 2012.)</p><p>In the promo for the Thursday, November 16, episode, Khloé, 39, informs her former partner, with whom she shares daughter <a href=#>True</a>, 5, and son <a href=#>Tatum</a>, 15 months, that “in this family if you do something to one of us, it affects everyone.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mario-Lopez-Calls-Out-Tristan-Thompsons-Comments-About-His-Past-Cheating-Scandals1.jpg><p>Thompson claims that he’s “in a place now where I can own up to the mistakes I’ve made.” He <a href=#>goes on to apologize</a> to <a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a> for <a href=#>cheating on Khloé</a> with the Kylie Cosmetics CEO’s then- best friend <a href=#><strong>Jordyn Woods</strong></a> in February 2019. “Everyone got affected differently, you know, but I think you were affected the most,” Thompson tells a tearful Jenner, 26, in the teaser.</p><p>Thompson and Khloé, who began dating in 2016, initially stayed together after he <a href=#>cheated on her with multiple women</a> days before True’s birth in 2018. The pair later <a href=#>called it quits</a> in 2019 after he and Woods, 26, kissed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mario-Lopez-Calls-Out-Tristan-Thompsons-Comments-About-His-Past-Cheating-Scandals2.jpg><p>The scandal <a href=#>took a toll on Jenner and Woods’ friendship</a>. “I’m not happy that people were hurt and people had to go through what they went through,” Woods shared during a September 2020 interview with <strong>Natalie Manuel Lee</strong>. “It was a lot for everyone, my family, other families, friends, and not in a million years have I had a negative intention to do something bad to anyone I love.”</p><p>The friends confirmed that they had made amends by stepping out for dinner in Los Angeles in July. “Kylie was the one to reach out to Jordyn. She missed her and felt enough time had passed and they wanted to meet up,” a source exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> at the time. “It’s a work in progress and they’re taking it slow,” a second insider added.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Khloé and Thompson, for their part, rekindled their romance in 2020 but ended things for good one year later when news broke that the athlete <a href=#>cheated again and fathered a child</a> with <a href=#><strong>Maralee Nichols</strong></a>.</p><p>New episodes of The Kardashians air on Hulu every Thursday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammaKevG64zqmcs2WdpLCsv4ytqaKrpJa7bsDHqKSpq5%2BjwG7Dx56lZqFdmLWmrdNmqK6npJp8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
