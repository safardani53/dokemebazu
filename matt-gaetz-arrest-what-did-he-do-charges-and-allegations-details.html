Charges And Allegations Details</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p><strong>The arrest of American lawyer Matt Gaetz</strong> has caused a political uproar, as the politician is being scrutinized over the sex scandal. Gaetz has represented Florida’s first congressional district in the United States since 2017. He is a Republican who has backed far-right politics and has backed former President Donald Trump.</p><p>The anti-LGBTQ legislator has survived the juvenile sex scandal that has dominated the press for the past two years. Rumors that the congressman has been hooking up with his male press assistant have been flying on Twitter this week. Let’s put it in context.</p><h2>Matt Gaetz’s Arrest and Charges: What Did He Do?</h2><p>Although Matt Gaetz has not been arrested, he is facing severe charges. The Democratic Party candidate who lost to Gaetz in Florida’s 1st congressional district last year, Rebekah Jones, seems to be the source of these claims. Rebekah’s questionable background makes it difficult to accept her assertions. For example, in 2019, she was arrested and accused of stalking her ex-boyfriend, who also happened to be a Florida State University student.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Matt-Gaetz-1.jpg alt="Matt Gaetz" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She had previously been charged with violating the provisions of a domestic violence restraining order involving the same ex-boyfriend, as well as felony robbery, trespassing, and contempt of court. Rebekah Jones is now after Matt Gaetz. She claimed in a series of tweets that several media had revealed Matt Gaetz’s affair with his press assistant, Joel Valdez.&nbsp;After the FBI purportedly received photographs of Gaetz “making out with young men,” she tweeted that the congressman’s office was in “upheaval.” Requests for a response from Gaetz’s office and his wife remained unanswered after all of these tweets became viral.</p><h2>Matt Gaetz: Who Is He? What Were His Previous Charges?</h2><p>Gaetz grew up in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, the son of well-known Florida politician Don Gaetz.&nbsp;He practiced law briefly after graduating from William & Mary Law School before choosing to run for state representative.&nbsp;He served in the Florida House of Representatives from 2010 until 2016. His support of Florida’s divisive “stand-your-ground” statute drew major media attention.</p><p>He was initially elected to the US House of Representatives in 2016, and he was re-elected in 2018, 2020, and 2022.&nbsp;Joel Greenberg, a buddy of US Representative Matt Gaetz, was sentenced to 11 years in prison for child sex trafficking. Joel Greenberg, a former Seminole County tax collector, was accused of stalking a political competitor, governmental corruption, issuing counterfeit licenses, and conspiring to submit false loan applications. He pled guilty to six federal charges, including conspiracy to bribe a public official, stalking, identity theft, and wire fraud.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Matt-Gaetz-2.jpg alt="Matt Gaetz" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to the prosecution, Greenberg reportedly paid at least one girl to have sex with him and other males.&nbsp;Greenberg’s participation might help an investigation into his friend Gaetz to discover if he paid a 17-year-old girl for sex.&nbsp;Gaetz first claimed that the claims were part of an extortion plan, which he has now denied.&nbsp;The Republican congressman, who represents the Florida Panhandle, has not been prosecuted.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikmqykYrSisdOzZJqqoprAtXnWoZitZZSesW60xGabqGWTna6zs8SsZJqmlGKurbjEoJitoZ%2BjwG6wxK2YoqSjZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
