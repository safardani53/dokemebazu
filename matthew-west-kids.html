Because of his career, of course, he wrote a song about it, but he may not have gotten the reaction he was hoping for.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In his latest song, "Modest Is Hottest," Matthew tries to encourage girls to dress modestly because that's what boys really want in a woman. His own daughters and his wife Emily star in the music video. But people aren't happy with the song's message, to say the least.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Matthew West's kids star in his latest music video.</h2><p>Matthew and his wife Emily have two daughters named Delaney Ruth West and Luella "Lulu" Jane West. They have grown up with their father being the music star that he is, but he's been open about how it's affected the family. He told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Tennessean</a> that it's the reason that he started homeschooling his daughters.</p><p>When his daughters asked, Matthew would say that he goes on tour to tell people about Jesus. But when they wanted someone else to spread the word, he made a change. He said he wanted to be more present and engaged with his family, and that was the inspiration behind his album, "All In."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Matthew West's new song has sparked backlash online.</h2><p>Now, Matthew is a Christian singer, so his music is all about his faith and beliefs. But that hasn't stopped people from being outraged by his latest song. "Modest Is Hottest" is all about him telling his daughters that dressing modestly is the best when it comes to dating.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The music video and song start off with Matthew wanting to have a conversation with his daughters. He says he understands that they're getting older and are beautiful, but that also means that boys will start giving them attention. Because of this, they should cover up because, according to the song, "What the boys really love is a turtleneck and a sensible pair of slacks."</p><p>As the video continues, we see Matthew talking to his girls in front of a display with a bunch of different kinds of clothes on it. He crosses out things like crop tops and yoga pants and circles "approved" things like mom jeans and raincoats. He says he'd rather them dress like Mother Teresa, Amish women, or "any librarian" instead of <a href=#>Cardi B</a> and <a href=#>the Kardashians</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Many people don't believe "modest is hottest," at least not in this context.</h2><p>Obviously, this didn't go over well online. Many people, both fellow Christians and others, are calling him out for lyrics that clearly make it a girl's responsibility to keep boys in check. The top comment on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">music video</a> at the time of publication says, "Mom of boys here. I’m writing a song called 'Pluck Your Eyes Out' because that’s what Jesus actually said."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>As a dad raising daughters, this song is my ridiculously silly way of reminding them that their appearance doesn’t define them. While the world might focus on the outward appearance, the Lord looks at the heart. Regardless, they are beautiful inside and out! (Even in turtlenecks)</p>— Matthew West (@matthew_west) <a href=#>June 18, 2021</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But Matthew himself has said that he doesn't take the song that seriously. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In a tweet</a>, he said that "Modest Is Hottest" is his "ridiculously silly way" of letting his daughters know that they are more than their appearance. "While the world might focus on the outward appearance, the Lord looks at the heart. Regardless, they are beautiful inside and out!"</p><p>But many responded saying he missed the mark with this one and that by saying "modest is hottest," he's still putting too much emphasis on his daughters' physical appearances, sexualizing them, and tying their worth to how they're perceived by men.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Matthew's whole family is involved in his music.</h2><p>It may just be part of the act, but Delaney and Lulu don't look happy to be in the "Modest Is Hottest" music video. Emily, on the other hand, looks to be having the best time. She's totally on board with the message of the song (or she understands the whole thing is meant to be a joke) and dances alongside Matthew while their daughters stand there.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>This isn't the first time Matthew has had his family involved in his music. Lulu is even featured on the song "Becoming Me" and appears in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">music video</a>.</p><p>It looks like "Modest Is Hottest" has completely missed the mark, though. Here's hoping that Matthew and Emily hear the criticism and understand what their "jokey" song is really saying.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq61wMeermavlajBbrfInao%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
