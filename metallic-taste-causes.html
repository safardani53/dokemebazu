it’s the same old message: Brush your teeth twice a day, floss, and clean your tongue!</p><p>There are some factors that raise the odds of a person getting gum disease, including hormonal changes, genetics, medications and certain diseases.</p><p>But some risk factors are changeable, including <a href=#>smoking</a>, drug use,&nbsp;<a href=#>vaping</a>, and obesity.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health</h2></p><p>If good oral hygiene alone doesn't help and your gums become very sore and swollen and teeth begin to fall out, then it's worth booking an emergency <a href=#>dentist </a>appointment.</p><h2>2.&nbsp;Drugs</h2><p>According to Dr Sophie, certain drugs can make your mouth taste a lot like blood.</p><p>"The <a href=#>antibiotic </a>metronidazole can often leave a metallic taste," she said.</p><p>Metronidazole&nbsp;is often given on the NHS as a treatment for skin infections,&nbsp;rosacea&nbsp;and mouth infections, including&nbsp;infected gums&nbsp;and&nbsp;dental abscesses.</p><p>In one study, which looked at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tastes left by medications</a>, experts suggested that people who experience this should consider gargling salt and baking soda.</p><p>Patients can mix a half teaspoon of salt and a half teaspoon of baking soda in one cup of warm water and rinse (but not swallow), they said.</p><p>It might also be worth speaking to a pharmacist for advice - do not stop taking the medication.</p><h2>3.&nbsp;Infections</h2><p>"Upper respiratory tract infections, such as <a href=#>tonsillitis</a>, can leave an awful taste in your mouth," the <a href=#>GP </a>said.</p><p>This is because upper respiratory infections are often paired with lots of coughing.</p><p>Repeatedly coughing up phlegm often brings small amounts of blood into the mouth and onto the taste buds, leading to a distinct metallic taste.</p><p>To get rid of the blood-like taste, try treating the cough with cough medicine or decongestants.</p><p>A common infection will often run its course in a few days or weeks.</p><p>But if you develop a fever above 39.4°C, have breathing trouble or cough up visible blood you should go to the doctor or <a href=#>hospital </a>immediately.</p><h2>4.&nbsp;Heartburn</h2><p>"Acid reflux (otherwise known as <a href=#>heartburn</a> or indigestion) can leave a bitter taste that some people describe as metallic," the GP explained.</p><p>This metallic taste in your mouth is&nbsp;caused by your stomach acid escaping into your throat&nbsp;and isn't easy to shake.</p><p>The taste should go away after you treat the indigestion.</p><p>Products like Gaviscon can help reduce the amount of heartburn.</p><p>If you've had heartburn most days for three weeks or more, the <a href=#>NHS </a>suggests you visit a GP.</p><h2>5.&nbsp;Psychological upset</h2><p>"<a href=#>Anxiety </a>and <a href=#>depression </a>can cause taste disturbance in taste which usually settles over time," the expert explained.</p><p>Researchers don’t yet know exactly why the metallic taste appears.</p><p>It may be because anxiety can cause your mouth to dry out, and the reduced flow of saliva leaves a bitter or metallic tastes.</p><p>One&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2017 study</a>&nbsp;showed that people with higher levels of anxiety often have a dry mouth condition called&nbsp;xerostomia.</p><p>It may be that anxiety-related taste changes happen because of chemicals released by your body’s fight-or-flight response.</p><p>Norepinephrine, one of the neurotransmitters your body releases when stressed, is known to temporarily change the taste receptors in your mouth, for example.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>If you're feeling stressed, anxious or depressed it's worth seeing a medical professional to get some help, whether that be therapy or medication.</p><p>Doctor Sophie has her own <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">youtube channel</a> which offers short videos giving advice on common health problems.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqGcmqSknXxzfJBpbGprZmS6psDApaOim12prrTAxGaamq2jmsBw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX -
