He had just enrolled in Penn State and was considered one of the country’s top college football prospects. He confirmed that his son was born on May 1, which would now make him almost 3 years old.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>These days, Micah has posted plenty of pictures with his little one in a football jersey — maybe he’s hoping his son will follow in his footsteps?

Micah said the decision was extremely hard for him, but because he had the support of his teammates and coaches, he decided to stay home with his son instead of going back to Penn State.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>Although Micah was actually held back in middle school and ultimately started college later than the average student, he was able to graduate in just two and a half years thanks to at-home classes and focusing on his academics instead of sports for 2020. As a result, he’s become a favorite for the NFL Draft sooner than expected.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Micah Parsons dealt with a college scandal around the time his son with his then-girlfriend was born.</h2><p>When Micah began playing for Penn State in 2018, he was also enmeshed in a scandal with fellow teammate Isaiah Humphries. Micah was accused of physically assaulting and sexually harassing Isaiah, and was consequently placed on probation. Around the same time, Micah’s son was born.</p><p>Although Micah publicly announced his son’s birth, he has not mentioned a special lady in his life. He kept his girlfriend unnamed at the time, and has not posted about her since. However, since Micah decided to stay with his son for the 2020 season, it’s very possible that he’s still with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his girlfriend</a>, and prefers to keep his romantic life private.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Micah shared with Penn State that “having a son… changes you,” and said that it shifted his priorities. In some ways, he wanted to continue reaching his dreams of being an NFL player, but in others, he preferred to focus on the dream of being a great father.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, Micah has the chance to be the dad he’s always wanted to be by giving his family the security and freedom he never had.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforakrcdmp5qqo6S7tHnSqKVmn5mnuae%2ByJ6lnQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
