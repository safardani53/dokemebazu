The glitzy final was meant to be held in Birmingham’s Hilton Hotel in July but this now looks in doubt too due to the lockdown.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>But when heats including the Miss Leicestershire event were dropped on March 27, instead of throwing in the towel, organiser Angie Beasley had a “lightbulb moment” and instructed the girls to do catwalks from their own homes.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>She exclusively told The Sun Online: “I had this lightbulb moment.
