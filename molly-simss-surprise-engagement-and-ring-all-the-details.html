But Sims had no idea her parents were part of the plan until after the proposal. “I called my brother and I was like, “I can’t get ahold of mom, I can’t get ahold of dad,'” she recalled of the hours before her engagement. “And finally about nine o’clock, I called my brother and I was like, ‘Listen, mom and dad are missing! I just want you to know that.’ Then, when Scott asked me, I called my brother back and I was like, ‘I’m engaged!’ and he was like, ‘I know.’ Then I went downstairs and my parents were at the kitchen table.” It was then that Sims got to reveal her ring, a glimmering, cushion-cut sparkler. <span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"></span>“I love everything about it!” she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>InStyle.com</a>, adding that she had “no idea how big it is.” Probably because she wasn’t privy to the details: “[Stuber] designed it,” she said. “He did it with my girlfriend on his own. He surprised me; I never sent him a picture. He did it all.” <strong>Tell us: What do you think of Sims’s ring?</strong> –Kim Peiffer, with reporting by Reagan Alexander<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>GET STARS’ DATE NIGHT LOOKS FOR LESS</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6Opxq2xjqampaSpYsCqudKsZKytoqW%2Fqr%2FEZpynn5Gcsq6xza1kmqaUYr%2BqusZmmKWkXam1pnnDnquaoZyofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
