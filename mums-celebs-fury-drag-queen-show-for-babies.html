Not for f**en babies.</p><p>“And if you think it is, there is something fundamentally wrong with you.”</p><p>The 49-year-old former partner of fellow actor <a href=#>Martin Freeman</a> was later forced to defend herself after some <a href=#>Twitter</a> users accused her of being transphobic.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON DRAG">READ MORE ON DRAG</h2><p>She hit back: “I lost quite a few followers for saying that a semi-naked man in thigh-high boots dancing in a highly sexualised way shouldn’t be performing in front of babies and it tells me everything I need to know about where society is heading.</p><p>“How do you not agree with me on this?”</p><p>The baby cabaret is on show at The Vault Festival in South East London and has also been staged in <a href=#>Manchester</a> and Tunbridge Wells, <a href=#>Kent</a>.</p><p>The organisers describe it as “a little slice of afternoon delight”, adding: “There’s only so many times you can listen to the f***ing Wheels On The Bus.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News</h2></p><p>But outraged parents on <a href=#>Mumsnet</a> were far from impressed.</p><p>On woman, calling herself Bloodyhellken, said: “It looks a bit like a really crap attempt at Cirque du Soleil but with added bum cheeks.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center><strong>‘What happened to fluffy bunnies?’</strong></h2><p>“I honestly don’t understand why anyone would go and see this with a child, or even offer it up as entertainment outside of a nightclub.”</p><p>A second, who uses the moniker lifeturnsonadime, wrote: “Why anyone thinks this is appropriate is beyond me, the parents are out of their minds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/FqK1JOHXsAIVQgq_MUZZEDjpg-JS799749504.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CABABABRAVE_wide_splash_muzzedjpg-JS799746634.jpg><p>A mum calling herself Bernardblackmolluscs said she was “judging the hell” out of parents who take their babies to the show,</p><p>And SunriseinWonderland wrote: “There is no way any child of mine would ever be taken to see that s**t.</p><p>“I have plenty of gay friends and live in <a href=#>Glastonbury</a>, which is alternative central, but no child should be exposed to a man in a fetish thong or normalise any of that stuff.</p><p>“What happened to fluffy bunnies and Beatrix Potter? Aren’t kids allowed to stay innocent now?”</p><p>Following the furore, one of the organisers took down her <a href=#>Facebook</a> page for the event and the <a href=#>Instagram</a> account has been set to private.</p><p>But The Sun has seen Facebook publicity shots for the show.</p><p>In one, a bearded man in a rainbow leotard is holding a cute tot while in another a performer in pink fishnets and matching leather boots is pictured on her hands and knees in a suggestive manner.</p><p>Another shows a topless female artist — wearing only a red thong and gold headband — holding a baby in the air.</p><p>One mum said: “This is just gross. It’s hardly <a href=#>panto drag</a>, is it?</p><p>“I have no qualms about taking my toddlers to see a panto dame but this is way over and above and really sexualised.”</p><p>In a plug for the event at The Vaults, the organisers describe the show as “a little slice of afternoon delight that provides show-stopping cabaret interspersed with captivating baby sensory moments...ending in a rave.”</p><p>They continue: “We wanted to create the type of event that we ourselves as mums would want to go to.</p><p>“We wanted to give parents the experience of a ‘big London night out’ — cabaret, drinks and dancing — but one you can bring your baby to and still be home for bedtime.”</p><p>The show is the latest drag queen controversy involving young kids.</p><p>It emerged last month that Britain’s libraries were <a href=#>hosting Drag Queen Story Hour</a> for three to 11-year-olds.</p><p>The organisers say it promotes that “being different is not a bad thing” but the sessions sparked anger from parents, who claim it is sexualised.</p><p><a href=#>Trans</a> rows have also hit British schools and colleges.</p><p>This week a school on the <a href=#>Isle of Wight</a> suspended its sex education curriculum after a drag queen guest speaker reportedly told 11-year-olds there are 73 genders.</p><p>One “upset” child responded saying “there’s only two” and was allegedly thrown out of the class.</p><p>Head teachers are being warned by ministers not to keep parents in the dark over trans teaching.</p><p>The <a href=#>Department of Education</a> has told heads they have an “obligation” to share material on sensitive topics, such as <a href=#>same-sex and gender issues</a>, with parents.</p><p>Last year, an elite music college was forced to issue an apology after claiming students who wanted single-sex spaces were “transphobic”.</p><p>The Institute of Contemporary Music Performance in London said there was a “zero-tolerance” approach to “Terfs” — a derogatory term linked with transphobic attitudes.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>‘Pretty horrific trolling attack’</h2><p>In <a href=#>Swindon</a>, teacher Kevin Lister, 60, was sacked from a further education college for not referring to a 17-year-old pupil, who was born biologically female, by their preferred male pronoun.</p><p>He is now taking action against the school and says “weak” leaders are being influenced by “trans activist teachers”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

handle Seasonofthewitch83 wrote: “This is an event that’s been established for quite some time, and the events always sell out.</p><p>“Many of the London mums’ Instagram accounts highly recommend it.</p><p>“A <a href=#>social media</a> pile-on is not on at all.</p><p>“Presumably if you do not want to attend this type of event, then don’t go.</p><p>“Not everyone hates drag acts.”</p><p>Calls and emails to The Vaults London from The Sun went unanswered.</p><p>Calls and texts to the CabaBabaRave’s number were also ignored.</p><p>The company posted on an <a href=#>Instagram</a> story: “Just to let our followers know — we have turned our profile to private for a while.</p><p>“We have been subjected to a pretty horrific trolling attack...and it just keeps coming.</p><p>“As mothers with young toddlers and one of us is heavily <a href=#>pregnant</a> this is more stress than we are able to deal with right now.</p><p>“These trolls specifically have a problem with drag artists and <a href=#>non-binary</a> performers performing for children...which is exceptionally sad, as those who have been to our event will know how much joy, love and happiness our shows bring.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>It added that the images and videos shared on social media were “specifically curated for very young babies and parents...not for ‘children of all ages as implied’.</p><p>The message went on to point out that cinemas across the country let parents bring babies to special screenings of films of all age ratings on a weekly basis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
