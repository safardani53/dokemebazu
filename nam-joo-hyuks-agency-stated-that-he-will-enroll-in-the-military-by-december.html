The agency‚Äôs confirmation read:</p><p>‚ÄúAlthough he is required to [enlist] in December, the precise date has yet to be determined since he has not yet been granted a draft notice.‚Äù</p><p>The actor from Start-Up was born in 1994, making him 28 years old. Korean law requires all able-bodied Korean males under the age of 30 to enroll for obligatory military duty.&nbsp;However, Nam Joo-hyuk is not the first Korean star born in 1994 to join the military this year. Song Kang, Jinyoung of GOT7, Kai and Sehun of EXO, and Kim Min-gue, among others, must join in the military before the end of the year. Nam‚Äôs military sentence will be for 18 months.</p><h2>Nam Joo-hyuk will finish his outstanding responsibilities before enlisting.</h2><p>Nam Joo-hyuk is presently filming the Disney+ series Vigilante. Not only that, but the great actor has a film named Remember coming out on October 26. After finishing his present projects by mid-November, the actor intends to enroll in the military.&nbsp;On social media, Nam Joo-hyuk fans responded to the news of his military recruitment. Check out some of the responses below. ‚ÄúStill in denial,‚Äù a fan remarked with sobbing emojis, probably referring to the fact that the world of Korean entertainment had to deal with two significant military-related stories.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nam-Joo-hyuk-2.jpg alt="Nam Joo-hyuk" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The first confirmation came from Nam Joo-agency, hyuk‚Äôs and the second from BIG HIT MUSIC, who verified BTS‚Äô much-debated military enrollment and indicated that the members would complete their national duty and serve in the military one by one, starting with the eldest member Jin.&nbsp;Nam Joo-hyuk is presently promoting his next film Remember, which will be released in cinemas on October 26. In-gyu, a young guy in his twenties, works with Pil-joo, an octogenarian with Alzheimer‚Äôs illness who yearns for revenge against the Japanese for years of colonization of Korea.</p><p>In-gyu is a cheery figure who becomes entangled in Pil-vengeance joo‚Äôs scheme. It‚Äôll be fascinating to witness how these unusual duo, who seem to have nothing in common, get caught in this intriguing bond and go on a mad vengeance scheme together.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>NAM JOOHYUK WILL ENLIST IN DECEMBER TO FULFILL HIS MILITARY SERVICE üò≠üò≠üò≠<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/oUvueSFQK3</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/gW8oI0aTdY</a></p><p>‚Äî bub ‡∑Ü (@jjwohyuk) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">October 17, 2022</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#NamJooHyuk</a> is set to enlist in the military in December. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Hk8ANdxl6s</a></p><p>‚Äî kdrama tweets (@iconickdramas) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">October 17, 2022</a></p><p>In addition, he will play Ji-yong, a university student who doubles as a vigilante in the drama version of the Naver webtoon of the same name. Ji-yong, his character, enrolls at the police school to seek down and punish his parents‚Äô adversaries.&nbsp;His character is skeptical of the present justice system and feels that offenders should not be given the benefit of the doubt. He believes that current rules should be reinforced so that even the most severe offenders cannot flee.</p><h2>More information about Nam Joo-hyuk</h2><p>The outstanding actor has entertained his fans with dramas such as Who Are You: School 2015, Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo, Start Up, and Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo, among others.&nbsp;For the actor, 2022 has been a mixed bag. With the coming-of-age drama Twenty-Five Twenty-One, which he co-wrote with Kim Tae-Ri, he had a major success. The drama was a worldwide smash sensation, garnering numerous prizes along the way.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nam-Joo-hyuk.jpg alt="Nam Joo-hyuk" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He did, however, suffer a personal setback when an anonymous classmate alleged on the internet that the actor was a school bully. Management SOOP refuted all of the charges and claimed that individuals spreading negative information about the actor will face severe consequences.&nbsp;Dispatch then undertook a personal inquiry among Nam Joo-old hyuk‚Äôs classmates and professors, who confirmed to his excellent behavior and refuted the continuing charges against him.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Actor</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Nam Joo-Hyuk</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGilmqVdn7yweceyrKSrXZa0prrCsmSsrJGpsqV506GYrWWYmnq4tculZJ6moqS5rXnIp2StoJViuqq4yK2Yq7Fdl8ZusMScnKaalad8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
