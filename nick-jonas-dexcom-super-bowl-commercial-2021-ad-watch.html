With a snap of his finger, the 28-year-old singer is suddenly a silver fox. Gone are his boyish looks, and instead, the pop star shows a touch of grey and a lot of wrinkles. In the past, this would be a marvel of CGI and special effects. Today, it’s an Instagram filter, which is why Nick asks in the commercial why “people with diabetes are still pricking their fingers? What?”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>After marveling about delivery drones, self-driving cars, vacuuming robots, and the fact that we’ve visited Mars, Nick is done with “fingersticks.” Enter the Dexcom G6, a glucose monitoring system that helps those with diabetes monitor their condition from the comfort of their mobile device. For Nick, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when he was only 13, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>finding a better way</a> to manage diabetes is a cause that’s near and dear to his heart.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Nick-Jonas-Ages-50-Years-Dexcom-Diabetes-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>“Too many people with diabetes suffer through painful, antiquated fingerpricks because they don’t know a better way exists,” said Jonas, in an accompanying press release. “I truly believe people with diabetes deserve <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the absolute best care</a>, and that’s really the spirit of my first Super Bowl commercial. It means so much to me to bring this message of awareness and the need for improved CGM access to as many people with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>diabetes</a> as possible.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Nick has also partnered with Dexcom to help bring a bit of joy for Super Bowl Sunday. Those with diabetes are at a higher risk of COVID-19-related complications, so social distancing and staying quarantined is a must. To help fans feel less lonely on Feb. 7, Dexcom will offer fans a chance to “watch the game” with Nick Jonas via an augmented reality experience.

The Dexcom G6 CGM system, per the press release, “uses a small wearable sensor and transmitter to measure and send real-time glucose values wirelessly to a compatible smart device or receiver, eliminating the need for painful fingerpricks. Dexcom CGM also displays trend arrows to show the speed and direction glucose levels are heading, making in-the-moment treatment decisions easier and helping people with diabetes avoid potentially dangerous high or low glucose events.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>For a list of compatible devices, visit <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>www.dexcom.com/compatibility</a>. Dexcom also noted that if glucose alerts and readings from the Dexcom G6 do not match symptoms or expectations, use a blood glucose meter to make diabetes treatment decisions.
