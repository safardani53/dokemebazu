I told him that I wanted to be a mum as soon as possible so we had our first child when I was 27, then our second when I was 29, and our third when I was 30.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>FABULOUS BINGO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GET A £5 FREE BONUS WITH NO DEPOSIT REQUIRED</a></strong></p><p>"But here's the thing; I love my kids but I don't think I'm a great mother. I'm just too selfish and self-absorbed.</p><p>"I know this because I've had years of counselling about it. I do think that people who are like me shouldn't be parents."</p><p>She then said that she will always complain when her children ask her to do something with them as she doesn't enjoy playing with the kids.</p><p>She said: "When they were toddlers I played with them as much as I could but I found myself getting so irritated over the slightest thing. Or when the kids had fights, I would fly off the handle. I just had no patience for them when they were small."</p><p>"And now that they're getting older, I haven't improved."</p><p>I do think that people who are like me shouldn't be parents.</p><p>She also explained that her "me time" was really important to her and that she was a Netflix "addict" and expected her children to go to their rooms at 8.30pm so that she could be left to watch her shows in peace.</p><p>The woman explained that all of this hadn't gone down well with her family as relatives challenged her behaviour.</p><p>She said: "My sister, who is a really good mother, tells me I'm being too selfish and I can't expect to have 'me time' every single night. Especially when the kids might need my attention or need help with homework.</p><p>"My sister said, 'Have you ever thought that your kids might just want to hang out with you? Maybe they can watch some Netflix with you instead of being banished to their rooms?'"</p><p>The mum explained that she did agree that she could do more and didn't want her children to view her as selfish and boring.</p><p>She said: "I am trying to change my ways... I'm doing my best!"</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>Want more parenting stories? <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">A woman confessed to being a "bad mum", and said that other parents hate her</a> because she lets her three-year-old son swear… but it’s always in the right context.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Plus, this mum shared&nbsp;<a href=#>the single word she uses to make her kids immediately stop and listen, tone and volume is key</a>.</p><p>And, another mum shared the&nbsp;<a href=#>genius way she stops tantrums without a time out</a>.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>People are annoyed that I ‘hung’ my baby in his carrier from a clothes rack</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5BvamxrY26FcLrOrWSgp5%2BZeq7BzGalqGWglsGqsc2cnGarlaGzqr%2FHaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
