She became a regular on local Australian radio and television shows. She recorded her first single, “Till You Say You’ll Be Mine” in Britain in 1966.&nbsp;She released her first solo album, If Not For You, in 1971 and the title track became her first international hit. Her follow-up single, “Banks of the Ohio,” was a top 10 song&nbsp;in Great Britain. She represented the United Kingdom during the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest. She placed fourth while the band&nbsp;<strong>ABBA </strong>won. Her album, Have You Never Been Mellow, topped the pop charts in 1975, but one of her biggest successes came in 1978. That’s when she was cast as Sandy in the film adaptation of the musical, Grease.
