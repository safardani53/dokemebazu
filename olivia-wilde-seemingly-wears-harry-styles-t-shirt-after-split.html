Wilde tucked the tee into her high-rise purple leggings and topped off her ensemble with black sneakers and Ray-Ban Wayfarer sunglasses.</p><p>Eagle-eyed followers were quick to point out that Styles, 29, was previously seen rocking the Beijing-based record label design. Styles wore the Space Fruity Records piece to the <a href=#><strong>Ariana Grande</strong></a> concert in London in August 2019, <a href=#>according to a fan fashion archive</a>.</p><p>Although it’s possible that Wilde purchased her own version of the clothing item, some social media users were convinced she was wearing her ex-boyfriend’s vintage shirt based on the color and worn look.</p><p>“So Harry is looking at Olivia on insta, Olivia is liking Gemma’s post about Harry (something she hasn’t done in over a year) she still has and is wearing his top … maybe there’s hope for them yet😏 #HarryStyles #OliviaWilde,” one fan tweeted on Wednesday, June 21, alongside <a href=#>a side-by-side photo of the exes</a> in the tee.</p><p>One week before seemingly making a fashion nod to her relationship with the “Watermelon Sugar” crooner, <a href=#>Wilde “liked” an Instagram video of Styles</a> performing a One Direction track at his Wembley Stadium show in London. The clip was shared by his sister, <a href=#><strong>Gemma Styles</strong></a>.</p><p>“Good GRIEF this show is fun,” she wrote on <a href=#>Thursday, June 15</a>. “So proud of you @harrystyles and what a privilege to see you experience this much joy doing what you love.”</p><p>The O.C. alum previously showed Harry support via social media in May by double-tapping a solo snap of the crooner celebrating the one-year anniversary of his Grammy-winning record, <a href=#>Harry’s House</a>.</p><p>“I’ve never been happier than making this album, thank you for everything,” he <a href=#>captioned the Instagram tribute</a>, which featured an image of himself wearing Aviator sunglasses while standing in front of a field.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Olivia-Wilde-Raises-Eyebrows-While-Seemingly-Wearing-Harry-Styles-T-Shirt-7-Months-After-Their-Split-626.jpg><p>Wilde was <a href=#>first linked to the British singer in January 2021</a> after they connected while working on their film, Don’t Worry Darling. The pair’s relationship came shortly after the director and ex-fiancé <a href=#><strong>Jason Sudeikis</strong></a> announced in November 2020 that they <a href=#>had broken up after nearly 10 years together</a>. (Wilde and Sudeikis, 47, share two children: Otis, 8, and Daisy, 6.)</p><p>After going public with Harry, Wilde was spotted in the crowd at <a href=#>various Love on Tour concert stops</a> throughout 2021. While the Drinking Buddies actress appeared to be one of Harry’s biggest fans, Us Weekly confirmed in November 2022 that <a href=#>the couple had split</a>.</p><p>“Olivia is still very much upset about the breakup,” <a href=#>a source exclusively told Us</a> one month later, noting that Wilde was “trying to move on.”</p><p>Earlier this year, a second insider told Us that <a href=#>Wilde “is ready to date again”</a> after taking time for herself post-split. “She isn’t looking for anything less than an amazing guy,” the source said in March.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Harry, for his part, was briefly linked to <a href=#><strong>Emily Ratajkowski</strong></a> that same month after the pair were spotted <a href=#>making out in Tokyo</a>. “Harry has always been very attracted to Emily,” <a href=#>a source exclusively told Us</a> after the kiss, adding that the “Cherry” singer was “thrilled” about “hooking up” with the model, 32.</p><p>Ratajkowski, meanwhile, played coy about the hookup in April. “I’m definitely still not thinking about guys,” she told <a href=#>the Los Angeles Times</a>&nbsp;when asked about her dating life following <a href=#>her 2022 split</a> from husband <a href=#><strong>Sebastian Bear-McClard</strong></a>. (The estranged spouses share <a href=#>2-year-old son Sylvester</a>.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6S5qsLImmSwoZyZsm6%2FxJ6koqaXocZuw8SaqaxlmJa%2Fs8WMrKuypJWoerV50qGgq6xdlrO1sdFmqqmkmal8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
