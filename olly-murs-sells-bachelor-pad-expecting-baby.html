that because of the colour of my skin and my <a href=#>religious</a> background that I wasn't a true Yorkshireman.</p><p>“Yes my heritage is mixed <a href=#>Indian</a> and <a href=#>Pakistani</a>, but the only place I have ever lived is Yorkshire.</p><p>“Being a Yorkshireman is who I am, and that will never change.</p><p>“Oh and I only drink Yorkshire tea (obvs).”</p><p>Good for you, Dr

taking it up a notch in the style stakes – as Amanda always looks effortlessly stylish.</p><p>“I thought, ‘I know she’s going to turn up in her boring black boiler suit’, so I told my stylist that I wanted to serve Dolce and Gabbana realness.</p><p>“If the show comes back for series three, you just wait – I might get Versace to do it.”</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">C4
