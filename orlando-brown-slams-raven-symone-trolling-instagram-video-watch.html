Orlando doesn’t look his best in the video and it’s not entirely clear exactly&nbsp;how&nbsp;Raven has been “trolling” his page, but that is what the rapper says she is doing. And he want’s it to stop.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>“Raven stop trolling my page!” Orlando says to the camera in front of a group of friends. “We all know why you won’t say s**t. Cause &nbsp;I’m the truest n***a in the mother-f***ing world. I’m tired. I’m gonna end this s**t. B***h stop trolling my page. I’m coming to see you. And we’re gonna end this s**t like real, real adults. You see what I’m saying. Like I’m not gonna play no more games. All that bulls**t, that you being quiet and not trying to help a n***a out. You know, by saying what?”</p><h3><a class=pmclinkcontent-post href=# rel=noopener>Click here to see pics of Raven Symone</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-3>“‘Hey, you know, Orlando is a great person,’ or ‘You know what? Let me call Orlando,'” the rapper says in his impression of The View co-host’s voice. “That’s so fake b***h!” he sings in a tune that we think&nbsp;is meant to be the&nbsp;That’s So Raven&nbsp;theme song. &nbsp;“I’m just saying. Be real. Be family. And that’s it. But other than that, don’t nobody ask me about no more That’s So Raven s**t. No. I’m grown. I’ve worked hard to be Mr. Brown. And that’s who I am, the legendary Mr. Brown. I’m a very talented person.
