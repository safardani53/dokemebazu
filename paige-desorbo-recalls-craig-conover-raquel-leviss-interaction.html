I clock Craig at the bar and I watch Raquel leave the dance floor and walk over to Craig,” the 30-year-old Summer House star, <a href=#>who has been</a> dating <a href=#><strong>Craig Conover</strong></a> since summer 2021, said at a recent <a href=#>“Giggly Squad” podcast</a> live show, per a video shared via <a href=#>TikTok</a>. “I’m standing there and I turn to literally everyone around me and I was like, ‘I don’t trust this bitch.’ … Everyone was like, ‘Oh, my God, no, she’s so sweet! She would never.’ And I f—king knew it.”</p><p>While the BFFs agreed that Raquel, 28, had always been “very nice to us,” Hannah, 31, joked, “But in a way like a hurt bird.”</p><p>The SURver was in attendance at the May 2022 nuptials as Shahs of Sunset alum <a href=#><strong>Nema Vand</strong></a>’s date, nearly three months before she and<a href=#><strong> Tom Sandoval</strong></a> secretly <a href=#>slept together for the first time</a> in August 2022. While 40-year-old Sandoval — who was dating longtime partner <a href=#><strong>Ariana Madix</strong></a> at the time — has insisted that the twosome briefly broke things off before falling “in love” in January, Raquel later confessed <a href=#>that their affair never ended.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Paige-DeSorbo-Recalls-Interaction-Between-Craig-Conover-and-Raquel-Leviss-at-Hannah-Berner-Wedding-3.jpg><p>“I think it’s important to me to tell the truth. I think that I’ve been lying and being so deceitful this entire time that I don’t want to lie anymore. And it’s all out there anyway. The worst is out. Yet I’m still finding myself having to lie about specific timeline things,” Raquel said in part 3 of the <a href=#>Vanderpump Rules reunion</a>, which aired earlier this month. “[Sandoval] feels like it would be less hurtful to say that this wasn’t going on for so long. … The second time was, it was actually during Mexico [for Scheana Shay’s wedding].”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Paige-DeSorbo-Recalls-Interaction-Between-Craig-Conover-and-Raquel-Leviss-at-Hannah-Berner-Wedding.jpg><p>Confirming that the infidelity was ongoing, Raquel said: “I don’t remember how often it would happen, but it definitely picked up speed more after we wrapped filming [in September 2022].”</p><p>She further admitted to sleeping with Sandoval while Ariana — who learned of the affair in March — was out of town at her grandma’s funeral.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Paige-DeSorbo-Recalls-Interaction-Between-Craig-Conover-and-Raquel-Leviss-at-Hannah-Berner-Wedding-2.jpg><p>“I know that the reason why Tom wanted to lie about is because it’s a really bad look to hook up with someone’s boyfriend in their own house, when they’ve gone out of town. Especially for a funeral of all things,” Raquel said through tears. “So I don’t know, this is f—king killed my soul. I am so sick of lying. I hate it. I hate being deceitful. It’s horrible.”</p><p>Paige and Hannah, meanwhile, questioned why Sandoval wasn’t by his girlfriend’s side as she mourned.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Why wasn’t Sandoval at the funeral?” Paige asked in the aforementioned clip.</p><p>Hannah added, “The whole thing is wild.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKeaoZeaeqWx0qipm6ddp7Kkrculqmabopa2qHnCqKWorpWnerOt0K6cpWWcmsOqv9JmoKeslaeupMDIqKVo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
