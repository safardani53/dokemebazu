This includes filtering and cleaning the pool and ensuring all areas surrounding the poolside are thoroughly disinfected.</p><p>"This process follows health and safety guidelines, and the outdoor pool area is then decommissioned for the season.</p><p>Dr Ian Cater, whose dog was a test subject for the first event last year, gave Doggy Splash a glowing review on behalf of his black Labrador, Oakley.</p><p>"Oakley was one of the first dogs to trial the sessions last year and he absolutely loved it," he said.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"It’s a trend that’s starting to pop up all over the UK and I thoroughly agree with it.</p><p>"It’s a great way to safely have fun with your dog in the water and brings a lot of joy to both the owner and dog.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/claims-water-becomes-unhygienic-pet-842655922.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4B5fZJqbXJnoJa%2FprrTrGSfrZ2aeqW7xqxkrK%2BZonqwwdOdpqiqXaW8sLiMobCgoZWjsnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
