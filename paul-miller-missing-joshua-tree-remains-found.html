The 51-year-old had ventured out to have one last hike before he and his wife, Stephanie Miller, began<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1> their journey back home to Ontario later that day</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Palm Springs Desert Sun</a>, Miller's rental car was spotted in a nearby parking lot a short time later, and more than 600 volunteers and 20 K-9 units were sent out to help locate him to no avail.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Efforts to find Miller over the last 18 months have come up short until photographs of the area were taken with a drone in November. After looking through the pictures, investigators spotted what looked to be human remains. They were recovered by park rangers on Dec. 20.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Tuesday, the San Bernardino County Coroner's Office notified the family that the remains were identified using dental records.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It has been a tough journey. Waiting. Waiting. Waiting," Stephanie told the Desert Sun after receiving the news. "Then, when you hear [he's been found] it doesn't make it any easier."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While they will likely never fully know the circumstances of Miller's death, Stephanie told the newspaper that they believe he could have possibly experienced a heart attack or heat stroke. Officials said there were no initial <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>signs of foul play after the remains were found in December</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I hated to think he was suffering, and we couldn't find him," Stephanie said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The family broke the news to followers of their Facebook page, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Find Paul Miller</a>, which had been set up in the days after his disappearance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The coroner's office was in contact with Paul's wife today to let her know of their findings. They have confirmed the remains to be Paul," a post on Tuesday <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>reads</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Thank you to everyone who has supported the search for answers into Paul's disappearance and provided much-needed love and prayer for his family," they added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Wednesday, the family <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>announced</a> a memorial service for Miller is set for Feb. 1 in Ontario.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the heartbreaking confirmation of her husband's death, Stephanie said she was inspired by how many friends and strangers came together over the last 18 months to help in search efforts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I have been amazed by the amount of people touched by his story," she told the Desert Sun. "It blows me away that strangers have kept us in their thoughts and prayers. I'm so grateful."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5iquqK6jKKlrZ2imsC1e8%2BarKVlnZ65rbHRZqSiq6Oeu6h5yaiqoa2RYsGzscRmqZ6lkZ67tHnFqKynnF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
