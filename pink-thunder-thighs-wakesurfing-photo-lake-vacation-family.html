The 40-year-old singer rode the waves like a pro on a wakeboard in an Instagram photo she shared with fans on Aug. 18. The mother of two showed off her strong and powerful legs maneuvering the board through a boat’s wake. She poked fun at her muscular limbs, captioning the photo, “I always wondered why God gave me thunder thighs. It’s cause he knew I’d use them.” The “Beautiful Trauma” singer has always been empowering about her body, and this caption was no exception.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The body-positive singer added the hashtags “#strongismygoal” and “#joyful” to her post, which got applause emojis from supermodel pal <strong>Gisele Bundchen</strong>, 40. Chef and cycling pal <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jason Roberts</strong></a> told Pink in the comments, “<span>I remember them strong legs crushing 100 miles to feed hungry kids&nbsp;@chefscycle…skills are multiplying,” referring to Pink biking 100 miles in a day in 2017 to raise money for the charity No Kid Hungry.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pink-wakeboarding-mega-post.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Joking about her figure aside, Pink, husband <strong>Carey Hart</strong>, 45, and their two children, daughter <strong>Willow</strong>, 9, and son <strong>Jameson</strong>, 3, are on a boating trip where she has been sharing IG photos <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>of her adorable family.</a> They appear to be on a getaway to central California’s Lake Nacimiento in San Louis Obispo County, where the fam <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>vacationed</a> in June 2019.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Pink shared a video of Carey holding onto Jameson as he took him for a wakeboarding session on Aug. 17, as <strong>DJ Snake</strong> and <strong>Lil Jon</strong>‘s 2013 smash “Turn Down For What” played in the background aboard the boat. Carey shared the same video to his IG page and gushed, “The stoke is real!!!!! Jamo’s 1st day on the @hyperlitewake wake surf board w/ papa. Kid is nuts!!!! Watch at the 30 second mark when he starts to head bang to @liljon. He said it’s his favorite song. I’m beyond stoked to have these moments w/ my family.

Have a great week, everyone.” What a way to spend a Monday!</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>In a super precious photo, Pink shared a selfie holding Jameson as he rested his head on her shoulder while still wearing his life vest.
