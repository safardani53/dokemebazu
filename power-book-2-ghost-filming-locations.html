While watching the series, fans have always pointed out scenes that showcase landmarks in New York City.

However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">several fan pages</a> on social media have already disclosed the primary filming location for Power Book 2: Ghost — it's New York City. Keep in mind, Power Book 2: Ghost is the sequel of the original series that documented James's reign as the biggest drug dealer in New York City. So, it makes perfect sense that showrunners continued to tell the story in the Empire State.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Various locations around the city have been used as backdrops for the series. From the New York City courthouse in Lower Manhattan to the Steiner Studios for interior shots, the series gives the city a new light. A Queens prison was also used for scenes featuring Tasha St. Patrick (portrayed by Naturi Naughton) when she was imprisoned.</p><p>Plus, a Brooklyn neighborhood has also been used for filming, per a Twitter thread.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Will there be a Season 3 of 'Power Book 2: Ghost?'</h2><p>If viewers could have it their way, the Power Book 2: Ghost storyline would never end. From Tariq’s new business relationship with the Tejada family to his college experience, there is a lot that showrunners can work with. Word on the street is that Season 3 has already been greenlit.</p><p>In a July 2021 Instagram Live session, Michael revealed to fans that Season 3 has already been renewed while responding to a troll about Power Book 3: Raising Kanan being renewed before it premiered.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>“We are already renewed for season 3. So, what do you want me to do with that information,” he said. “That is not useful. As soon as we are done with [season 2] two more months of break and we back filming Season 3 while y’all watching season 2. So, they can get renewed, but we are going to get renewed as well."</p><p>Even though Starz and show creator Courtney Kemp have yet to confirm or deny Power Book 2: Ghost being renewed, Courtney has confirmed that she has five or six seasons in mind for the series.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“The big shift that I’m planning for Season 5 would take the show in a direction where, frankly, it could go on forever,” Courtney told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>. “The show could go for 10 seasons or more considering that shift and it’s a big shift. But if that happens, we can go forward for sure and do some fun stuff. But that depends on whether we make it there.”</p><p>Catch the Season 2 premiere of Power Book 2: Ghost on Nov. 21, 2021 on Starz.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpby4sdFmmainm2J%2FbrPHqKqtZZaeua61zaBkpaeTlsGqu82s</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
