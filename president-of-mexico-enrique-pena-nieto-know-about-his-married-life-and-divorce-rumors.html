Her luxurious lifestyle and herself failing to perform as a role model for the nation are considered to be one among the many reasons that people hate her. Since people don’t like her there is also pressure for the president to split up to avoid the negative impression.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Some sources have also suggested that their marriage is on the brink of collapse as the couple seems to have some issues with each other.
