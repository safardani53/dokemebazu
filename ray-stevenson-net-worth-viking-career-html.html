He has also given his voice to productions such as&nbsp;The Super Hero Squad Show&nbsp;(2009),&nbsp;Star Wars: Rebels&nbsp;(2016-2017), and&nbsp;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&nbsp;(2020).</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>All of this contributes to him being on the brighter side when it comes to money. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, the actor has a net worth of $8 million. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Ray Stevenson met an Australian actor, and His Life Changed</h2><p>Born in a British military base as&nbsp;George Raymond Stevenson&nbsp;on May 25, 1964, in Lisburn, Northern Ireland, Ray’s father was a British pilot in the Royal Air Force, and his mother was Irish. He spent his childhood in Lemington, Newcastle Upon Tyne, and Cramlington, Northumberland.</p><p>Ray was passionate about performance and art from a very young age. However, as a grown-up, he ended up working as an interior designer with an architectural firm in London until his mid-twenties.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>But one day, he met an Australian actor and told him about his interest in acting. The actor then helped him to carve out a plan to pursue acting professionally. He disclosed to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Moviemaker</a>&nbsp;that he opened up to the stranger over “three bottles of red wine.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“I opened up to him and said I had this desire to be an actor. He then set me on a path to go to a bona fide school with people in the business. I was about 25 at the time. I went to the first audition of my life and, basically, I knew within two weeks that it was going to turn my life around,” said Stevenson. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>The realization that he should pursue acting<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">&nbsp;presented a dilemma</a>&nbsp;for him. He was taking a&nbsp;decision that could result in him losing his career. He had to take a complete u-turn over how he thought and decided to pursue what he loved.&nbsp;</p><p>I had to face up to the realisation and it was an epiphany: that what I thought was a decision to be an actor was false. There was no decision to make. It’s a vocation. I had no choice...I used to think it was an alter-ego. I never told anybody I wanted to be an actor when I was growing up. I went to drama school when I was 27 ... I was 29 when I finished. I couldn’t do this if I didn’t truly love it. It beats you up.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>During this time, he attended Bristol Old Vic Theatre School and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">graduated</a>&nbsp;from there at the age of 29.</p><h2>Ray Stevenson is Happy to Start Late with Experience</h2><p>Learning the antics of the acting business in his late twenties, Stevenson realized the necessity of “life experience” to become successful in the acting business.&nbsp;</p><p>In his October 2011 interview with&nbsp;Moviemaker, he stated that he was glad that he didn’t rush his acting career at “18” or “19” without experience. However, he balanced that perspective by implying that it would have been too late for him if he had started acting in his 30’s.</p><p>With acting, you try to be real about what’s around you, but you also get yourself full of wishful thinking, projecting what you want to be and what type of career you want to have.</p><p>Still, he wasn’t sure if anyone should take quick decisions about their life.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“But you have to be careful that you don’t miss out on the career you’re having. It’s a tough profession at the best of times,” stated Stevenson.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6euunnSrZyvnZ6ovK95zZ6rZq%2Bfp8GpedWioqKml2Kwor7EnqlnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
