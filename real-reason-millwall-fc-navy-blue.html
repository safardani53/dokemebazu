Morton itself had been founded in <a href=#>Aberdeen</a>, <a href=#>Scotland</a> in 1849 to supply ships with food.</p><p>And while not all the workers who came to the Isle of Dogs hailed from Scotland, there was certainly a strong Scottish contingent present in Millwall's first ever footy team.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More in Football">Read More in Football</h2><p>This was reflected in Millwall's traditional&nbsp;kit, which consists of dark blue shirts, white shorts, and blue socks - the colour of the Scottish flag.</p><p>This colour was chosen because it paid homage to the Scottish roots of the club, according to Richard Lindsay's book 'Millwall: A Complete Record'.</p><p>For the first 50 years, up until 1936, they played in a traditional navy blue that was very similar to the colours of&nbsp;Scotland national team.</p><p>Although the club adopted a lighter royal blue in 1936, Millwall went back to their roots in 2010.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p>As it was the 125th anniversary of the club, they re-adopted the darker navy blue of their first strip and it has stayed the same since.</p><p>The club's crest <a href=#>features</a> a lion rampant, which again seems to be an obvious indication of the club’s Scottish roots.</p><p><a href=#>Notorious Millwall hooligan Ginger Bob</a> also claimed this was due to the club's original influence with Scotland.</p><p>Ginger Bob, 65, joined the infamous&nbsp;Millwall&nbsp;Bushwackers when he was just 11 years old.</p><p>And after working his way up through various sub-firms he went on to become one of the Bushwackers' top chiefs.</p><p>He told James English's&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Anything Goes podcast</a>: "The history of the club is Scottish, Millwall's original colours are Scottish colours."</p><p>However, some club historians believe this is a matter of accident rather than design.</p><p><a href=# aria-label="Millwall History Files (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Millwall History Files</a> claim that in the club's cup run to the Semi Finals in 1900, they were referred to as Lions for their acts of giant killing.</p><p>They say that this is when the name stuck and was adopted as the clubs nickname and emblem.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>The club’s first headquarters were in the rooms of The Islanders pub in Millwall.</p><p>Millwall FC inhabited four different grounds in the club's first 25 years with their current stadium known as 'The Den'.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/andrew-milligan-pa-wire-restrictions-365197038.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH9zfZVwcGptX6eyoriMq5yaq5%2Bjeq61y6WumqScYrOkec2arbJlkqHCpns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
