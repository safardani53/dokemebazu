This is just something that she does. Gizelle has a history, and there is a reputation there, of her being fast.”</p><p>The Deep Space musician, who married Chris, 44, in 2018, conceded that Gizelle, 52, is “a beautiful woman,” but then doubled down on her original comments. “A shell is a shell, OK? And shells often have funky insides,” she said.</p><p>Things heated up between the two <a href=#>RHOP cast members</a> while filming season 7 of the reality series, which premieres on Bravo on Sunday, October 9. In a teaser for the new season, Gizelle told Candiace that her husband Chris made her “uncomfortable” with his flirty behavior. Later in the clip, Candiace informed Chris that the Texas native is dead to her.</p><p>Gizelle, for her part, exclusively told Us Weekly on Monday, October 3, that she didn’t appreciate <a href=#>how her costars handled the situation</a>.</p><p>“I was very honest and forthcoming about, like, how things made me feel. I just don’t like how it was handled from their perspective,” she said.</p><p>After the “Reasonably Shady” podcaster told <a href=# rel=noopener>Hollywood Life</a> on Tuesday, October 4, that the season 7 drama made her “reevaluate the friendship” she had with Candiace, the “Win” singer <a href=# rel=noopener>fired back on Twitter</a>.</p><p>“Let’s be honest. You are no one’s friend. You come collect a check and go home to those purple walls. The small part of me that DID want to believe weren’t total garbage woke up when you decided to get creative with my husband,” Candiace wrote alongside a screenshot of an excerpt from Gizelle’s interview.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>When Gizelle was asked if her <a href=#>relationship with her costar</a> is the worst it’s ever been, she told Hollywood Life, “100 percent. Yeah. With no turnaround.”</p><p>The <a href=#>reality TV personality</a> added that Candiace didn’t show any gratitude when she expressed concerns about Chris. “She didn’t appreciate it or care one way or the other. So as a friend of mine, I’m like, ‘wait a minute, I was riding for you’. And she couldn’t care less,” she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaroJ%2BlwG6vwKebopmTmnqprdJmpayep2Kwra3Pm5ico12bvLN5xqKxnqScmnqiucidZJ%2BdpZl8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
