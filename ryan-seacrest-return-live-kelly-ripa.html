Yes,&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ryan Seacrest</a>&nbsp;</strong>was back to co-host&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Live With Kelly&nbsp;</a>on Tuesday, June 20.

The episodes that Ryan appears in were all pre-recorded before his departure from the show in April, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Weekly.</a>&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>While Ryan’s appearance on Tuesday may have surprised some fans (especially when he said that it was June 20), it’s not a permanent return. Ryan is expected to make appearances in quite a few pre-taped segments this week and throughout&nbsp;Live’s&nbsp;summer run. Kelly will be joined by a series of different co-hosts in pre-recorded episodes, including Mark,&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Anderson Cooper</a>,&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Andy Cohen.&nbsp;</strong></a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ryan-Seacrest-kelly-ripa-live-abc-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Mark will also be joining Kelly during a Fourth of July special. There are also a series of themed weeks following that, including “Aches and Pains” week and “Dog Days of Summer” week, which will feature health tips and highlight puppies up for adoption, respectively.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The&nbsp;American Idol&nbsp;host</a> announced that he’d be <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>stepping away from&nbsp;Live&nbsp;</a>in a February episode of the show. He said that it was a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“tough decision,”</a> but praised Kelly and shared that Mark would be stepping in as co-host. “Working alongside Kelly over the past six years has been a dream job and one of the highlights of my career,” he said. “She has been an <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>amazing partner,</a> friend, and confidant, and although we will always be a part of each other’s lives, I will <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>miss our mornings together.”</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Kelly said goodbye to Ryan after co-hosting together for six years on April 14. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>She got emotional</a> while giving him a proper send-off. “I’m so grateful that our success together on this show has led to us developing an even closer, yet also co-dependent relationship,” she said in part. While Ryan is no longer co-hosting, the pre-taped segments are not his first return to the show! He made a<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> surprise appearance</a> on May 18, where he spoke about how much he’s enjoyed seeing Kelly and Mark co-host together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH13e5FpZquxkaN6tLHAnKmeq6Riv6bA1KulZqSZq7Jut8Slo7Jlop69ons%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
