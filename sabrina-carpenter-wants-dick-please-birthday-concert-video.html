The pop star, who turned 24 on Thursday May 11, revealed that she would like ‚Äúd***‚Äù as her b-day present during a freestyle session of her song ‚ÄúNonsense‚Äù in New York on Wednesday, as seen in video below. After a tweet claimed the request was merely in jest, the former Disney star doubled down by retweeting the post on her own <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Twitter</a> and adding, ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt a joke.‚Äù</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The jaw-dropping insight into Sabrina‚Äôs personal life comes after the actress was rumored to be in a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>romance with <strong>Shawn Mendes</strong> </a>after the pair were spotting hanging out at a dinner in Los Angeles in February. During an appearance on the Dutch program, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>RTL Boulevard</a> on March 17, Shawn addressed the gossip. ‚ÄúWe are not dating,‚Äù he admitted. They were also&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spotted </a>at the Gucci store in Beverly Hills for a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Miley Cyrus album-release party</a>&nbsp;in early March.</p><p>As fans know, Shawn has been <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>rekindling his romance with <strong>Camila Cabello</strong></a> after they were snapped <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>packing on the PDA</a> at Coachella. Since then, Shawn has been <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spotted buying flowers</a> for a date with Camila and enjoying a comedy show in Hollywood with her, where they, once again, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>locked lips</a>. The couple had initially <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>separated in Nov. 2021</a> with a joint statement to their respective Instagrams, writing in part, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve decided to end our romantic relationship but our love for one another as humans is stronger than ever.‚Äù</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>‚ÄúTOMORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY, I WANT DICK PLEASE‚Äù IM CRYING.
