I have people here.'”</p><p>“And then my mom said she forgot something at the store. So, I got in the car and went to the store with her. When we came back and walked in the door, no one was there,” she explained.&nbsp;</p><p>But luckily their best friend’s kid Dylan was in on the surprise and directed them by saying, “Hey, I think they’re looking for you outside.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Savannah walked outside to the beautifully lit up Christmas scene which was displayed in her backyard, Nic’s family was standing on one side, as the Chrisley’s were on the other.</p><p>“This isn’t really about to happen,” Savannah recalled saying as she started to freak out.&nbsp;</p><p>“And then, Nic looks at me and he was like, ‘Hey babe, will you come here?’ And you can tell he was so nervous, and I was nervous,” she continued.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“That was a long walk.

And the fact that both of our families were there made it even better,” she shared about the unforgettable night.&nbsp;</p><p>The duo&nbsp;apparently had been planning for this moment for quite some time, especially when it came to the ring.&nbsp;</p><p>“He sent me a picture of a ring on Instagram one day and it was hideous,” says Chrisley. “He was like, ‘Do you like this?’ And I was like No, no.’</p><p>“I immediately sent him a picture of what I liked.”</p><p>Savannah even confessed that her mom Julie Chrisley actually picked out her engagement ring.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“My mom actually kind of picked out the ring, and so she went and sat down with a jeweler in Nashville and picked out the diamond and all of that,” she added.&nbsp;</p><p>“And so, it’s kind of cool to know that she picked it out.”</p><p>The ring was designed by Dror Flantzman in Nashville and is a 5-carat ring which consists of radiant brilliant cut diamonds in the center with 18 round brilliant cut diamonds around it, as reported by People.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only was her mother involved in the engagement process, but of course <a href=#>her dad had to be&nbsp;involved as well</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Todd, being the overbearing and protective father he is, reportedly spoke with Nic before the proposal.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s funny because Nic wanted to ask them in person, but he was in Canada and we were all in Nashville,” says Chrisley.</p><p>“He FaceTimed my dad. My dad said he was so nervous when he FaceTimed him, that he asked my dad for his hand in marriage!”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Todd’s humor got the best of the situation as he said, “You may want to re-ask that question.”</p><p>“He was like, ‘Do you want my daughter’s hand in marriage or my hand in marriage?'”</p><p>Nic, who is a professional hockey player, apparently hung up the phone before calling him back and asking the right way.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“And it was just so funny. My dad said he was so nervous,” Savannah spilled.</p><p>And although the happy young couple is thrilled for their next chapter, they’re in no rush to tie the knot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“We’re taking our time,” Chrisley admitted when asked about the wedding planning.&nbsp;</p><p>“Just because you’re engaged doesn’t mean you have to get married tomorrow.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“We know that we want to spend the rest of our life with each other,” said the soon-to-be bride.</p><p>Besides&nbsp;<a href=#>Savannah’s been too busy filming </a>the spinoff show&nbsp;Growing Up Chrisley&nbsp;with brother Chase to have the time to plan her fairytale wedding, which we’re sure it will be.&nbsp;</p><p>The show, which revolves around the close-knit siblings testing out their so-called passions on the West Coast, airs on Tuesdays on the USA network.&nbsp;</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Savannah Chrisley: The Most Gorgeous Photos of USA’s Brightest Young Star!</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pxX2WBcL%2FAr5inppGdeqS00aKqpZ2pYra0ecSnnpqflZl6tbuMp6CcZZuav6W1y56qZpmWqbKzedKuqamqmaiybrzRqKdo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
