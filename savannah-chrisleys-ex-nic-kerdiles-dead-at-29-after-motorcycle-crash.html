According to the outlet, Kerdiles allegedly ran through a stop sign into the side of a BMW sedan. Police transported both drivers to a local hospital, shortly before Kerdiles was pronounced dead.</p><p class=p1>Several hours earlier, Kerdiles shared a look at his late-night <a href=#>motorcycle ride</a>. “Night rider,” he captioned a Friday, September 22, Instagram Story photo of himself on his Indian bike.</p><p class=p1>Kerdiles’<a href=#> first pro hockey team</a>, the Anaheim Ducks, paid tribute shortly after news broke. “We’re heartbroken to hear the news about Nic Kerdiles, who died in a motorcycle accident this morning,” a Saturday post on their <a href=#>Instagram</a> read. “An Irvine native, Nic became the first player from Orange County to play for the Ducks, in 2017. Our thoughts and deepest sympathies go out to his family and loved ones.”</p><p class=p1>No further details about the accident or the other driver’s condition have been revealed.</p><p class=p1>Born in Texas, Kerdiles was drafted to the National Hockey League in 2012 as a member of the Anaheim Ducks.

He retired from the sport less than one year before <a href=#>proposing in April 2019</a>. Kerdiles and Chrisley, now 26, <a href=#>called off their engagement one year later</a>.</p><p class=p1>“Nic and I, we’re on good terms,” Chrisley <a href=#>exclusively told <i>Us Weekly</i> in November 2020</a>. “We’re both so young and ambitious, and you know, we’re<a href=#> trying to find our way</a> in life. … No decision is ever permanent, so you never know what can happen. We have the rest of our lives to figure things out.”</p><p class=p1>While Kerdiles and Chrisley <a href=#>reconciled in April 2021</a>, their reunion was short-lived. The <a href=#><i>Chrisley Knows Best </i></a>alum — who currently has <a href=#>custody of siblings Grayson and Chloe</a> after parents <a href=#><strong>Todd</strong> and <strong>Julie Chrisley</strong> were sentenced to prison</a> for fraud — is now <a href=#>dating former football player </a><strong><a href=#>Robert Shiver</a></strong>.</p><p class=p1>Kerdiles has not publicly dated anyone since his split from Savannah, instead focusing on his <a href=#>real estate</a> career in Nashville.

I will never again take these days with them for granted and my advice is the same for everyone else. Love is unconditional, and it’s rare to find in this world.”</p><p class=p1>Nic concluded: “I’m so thankful that I have parents, siblings, nieces and nephews that love me back the way they do.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasmaaWu6%2Btx2aaoaqZqLmmxdJmnLFlnp6wbrfEq5uipJWoeqWxwJ1kmqxdZ4ZurcWtnKtlnaTBsL7CspqlnV2Yv6K%2Fx2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
