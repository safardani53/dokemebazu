The&nbsp;Into The Sun musician was the spitting image of the “Imagine” singer during the late 60s, with long hair and prominent thick-rimmed glasses. Even his turquoise suit and star-covered black undershirt were reminiscent of some of the fabulous suits that John wore throughout his career!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sean-Lennon-Looks-Like-Dad-John-Long-Hair-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Sean’s girlfriend also looked incredibly stylish with her outfit, which seemed inspired by a classic Hollywood gangster look. Charlotte sported a pinstriped blazer over a tiny black leather playsuit, along with black tights and a pair of dark brown booties. She really tied the look together with a gray wide-rimmed fedora over her brightly-colored orange hair!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Sean was the Beatle’s second son after <strong>Julian Lennon,</strong> 58, who John had with his first wife&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Cynthia</a>.&nbsp;</strong>Sean was the only child that John had with his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>second wife</a>&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Yoko Ono</a>,&nbsp;</strong>88. John had even penned the touching tribute “Beautiful Boy” from his 1980 album Double Fantasy for Sean. The track from the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>singer’s final album</a> even included John giving his boy a sweet message at the end. “Good night, Sean. See you in the morning, bright and early,” John whispers at the end of the song.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sean-Lennon-Looks-Like-Dad-John-Long-Hair-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>The “Working Class Hero” singer’s son&nbsp;has followed in his late father’s footsteps in more ways than just looks! Sean has had a successful music career in his own rite, releasing two solo albums and playing with a bunch of different bands, including his mom’s Plastic Ono Band. He’s also produced countless albums for other artists, including <strong>Lana Del Rey’s&nbsp;</strong>2017 hit&nbsp;Lust for Life.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>John was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tragically murdered</a> at age 40 <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>on December 8, 1980</a> by <strong>Mark David Chapman,&nbsp;</strong>66. Chapman shot the singer as he was going into his New York City apartment at The Dakota. Sean was only five when his father was killed. John’s older son Julian was 17. For the murder, Chapman received a 20 years to life sentence and has been in prison since he killed the Beatle. He was first made eligible for parole in 2000, but he’s been denied 11 times, most recently in August 2020. His next hearing will be in August 2022, via&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rolling Stone.&nbsp;</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe49qZqydkaN6rbHNp6anZZSWsW62zqGlZqSfpLhurcuiop5loJ28tbvSaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
