The&nbsp;Superbad&nbsp;star showed just how much he cared for early on when sharing a hilarious story about her rejecting him on a birthday date when they started going out. The self-identified “bad dater” revealed that he cried when she said, “no” after he asked her to be his girlfriend in a February appearance on<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Jimmy Kimmel Live! </a>“I was so young. I guess you don’t ask, ‘Will you be my girlfriend?'” he quipped.&nbsp; “I had terrible experiences dating women and I think the women who dated me also did not have the best experiences.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>They’ve also started the organization Hilarity For Charity together, which aims to bring comedy and good causes together. The pair spoke about how helping Lauren care for her mother when she was suffering from Alzheimer’s lead to the idea for the charity in a December 2022 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Washington Post.</a>&nbsp; Seth spoke about how the experience was important to him. “I tried to be as supportive as I could. I mean, we were pretty young when we started dealing with it. We were in our 20s, you know, and it was my first real long-term relationship I’d ever been in,” he said. ” I think it brought us closer, ultimately, and I think it probably forced us to confront many realities that we would have had to confront eventually, you know.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9Keq6FloqS0prqMsKCfnV1phXKClmtwaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
