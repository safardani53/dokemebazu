They took the plunge into sex work after Kayla was furloughed during the pandemic.</p><p>Jack said it was a case of thinking: “We’ll just try it and see what happens.”</p><p>Kayla added it was "for fun and games, and to see if anyone wants to watch us have sex, surprisingly people do".</p><p>Unsuspecting Alice didn’t know what she was letting herself in for, confessing: “I’m feeling quite nervous actually, I was feeling quite excited, and then I was thinking about what was actually going to happen and now I’m quite nervous. "</p><p>Watching the session as well as Alice was a man going by the name of Ph30n1x, who tuned in via webcam, as Jack explained: “We’re going to show Ph30n1x a couple of tricks.”</p><p>Alice didn’t know where to look while Kayla and Jack got down to it, putting on a show for their viewer. She admitted: “Kayla and Jack had tried their best to describe what the show would be like, but I was not prepared for the reality of watching two people have sex, just two meters away from my face”.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>Jack and Kayla said they had made around £40 from 20 minutes of work, with Alice left wondering if it was worth it: “It does seem like a lot of effort for £40”, but Jack argued: “If you were to call it a day now it would be, but that’s just the first show. We’ve only been on twenty minutes, and we’ve made £40.</p><p>“If we stay on another forty minutes and we continue at that rate it’s £120 an hour. It isn’t bad going for a job.”</p><p>Viewers couldn’t believe what they were seeing, with one writing: "Literally crying at Alice in the corner watching Foxy and Felix."</p><p>One joked: “Alice Levine is so joyfully awkward #ch4 #sexactually."</p><p>“That's the face of someone trying really hard to go to her happy place,” added another, about Alice’s awkward glances.</p><p>“Howling at Alice Levine sat watching someone having sex in front of her,” laughed a fellow viewer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000681304963.jpg><p><strong>Sex Actually is on Channel 4 on Wednesday at 10pm.</strong></p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The Sun Showbiz team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGlmZ39xfJJuZqydqGKupMDUmqOlsV2YvLa8y55kq6edpXqnscStZJqvka56orjInJxmpJWrtq%2Bxjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
