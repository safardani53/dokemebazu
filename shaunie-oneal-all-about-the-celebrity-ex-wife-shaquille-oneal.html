Shaunie filed for divorce again in 2009, alleging irreconcilable differences.&nbsp;In 2011, their divorce was completed.</p><p>Her ex-husband recognized his wrongdoing to People when discussing his marriage. I was a jackass.&nbsp;You never realize how nice you have it until it’s gone, he told People.&nbsp;Shaquille disclosed his adultery as the cause for the termination of their seven-year marriage in his book “Shaq Uncut: My Story,” noting that he was a person with too many choices and confessed to not being the greatest companion.&nbsp;He and Shaunie have four children: two boys, Shareef, 22, and Shaqir, 19, who play basketball in the NBA’s development G League and at Texas Southern University, and two daughters, Amirah, 21, and Me’arah, 16.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Shaunie-ONeal-1.jpg alt="Shaunie O'Neal" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Shaunie has a son named Myles from a previous relationship.&nbsp;Shaunie feels relieved when her ex-husband acknowledged being wrong throughout their marriage. She told Page Six that she is glad he (her ex-husband) is free to express his true feelings, but it was a long time ago, and she doesn’t have an opinion on it since she is in a different phase of her life.&nbsp;What he needs to communicate for his truth to be revealed is what it is.&nbsp;She also revealed her frustration with being questioned about her ex-husband, whom she divorced about 13 years ago.</p><h2>Pastor Keion Henderson is now her happily wedded husband.</h2><p>Shaunie’s life has progressed and she is now happily married to her current spouse, Pastor Keion Henderson.&nbsp;She told Page Six that Shaquille never properly proposed to her. She was invited to marry but not proposed to.&nbsp;Pastor, on the other hand, got down on one knee and proposed to her with his hand in the air, something she had never seen before.&nbsp;They dated for two years before getting engaged in November 2021 and marrying in 2022.</p><h2>A picturesque outdoor wedding ceremony</h2><p>Shaunie and Keion were married in a stunning outdoor wedding on May 28th at Aurora Anguilla Resort and Golf Club.&nbsp;There were about 200 people in attendance to celebrate their special day.&nbsp;Yolanda Adams serenaded Shaunie as she went down the 10th hole of the golf course in her extra-vagant bridal attire.</p><p>Her three boys escorted her down the aisle to make the occasion even more memorable. With her father’s death in February, she was unsure how she would go down the aisle.&nbsp;Losing her father while organizing her wedding was too much for her, so her boys took over, she said. Her five children were all there to support her in every way.&nbsp;Keion raved over Shaunie as well, describing her as a stone-cold fox, the most laid-back, humorous, fun-loving person, and a lady of religion.</p><h2>Her ex-husband was invited to her wedding.</h2><p>Shaunie told an unusual tale about how she ended up asking her ex-husband to her wedding during an exclusive interview with E! News. She said that their daughter celebrated her lovely sixteenth birthday in May, soon before their wedding. They were at her birthday celebration when Shaquille inquired if he was invited to her wedding. Of course, you are, Shaunie said.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Shaunie-ONeal-2.jpg alt="Shaunie O'Neal" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She then remembered rolling her eyes and asking, “I mean, you are, but do you have to come”? According to Shaunie, this has been their banter. She also said that he would not be attending but had received a courtesy invitation. The ex-couple co-parents their five children and is on good terms with them. Shaunie said that they needed to find a place where they could communicate while still being friends.&nbsp;And they don’t chat about daily things, but they do get together for the kids and respect one another’s spaces and the settings they are in.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>She has a staggering net worth of $35 million as of September 2023, which she accumulated from her marriage to one of the most accomplished NBA players, Shaquille O’Neal, as well as her profession as an entrepreneur and media personality.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqoZmlo7amec6nnJqkXZa5rXnAm6aurF2ptaZ5wp6jnpqinsG6ecSxZLChlpp6tLTAqqyipJyaerC6xJqjaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
