Noting that Adams, 34, originally advised her that Hyland — who <a href=#>he started dating</a> in 2017 — was “the biggest Hills fan,” Pratt took the opportunity to introduce herself at <a href=#><strong>Paris Hilton</strong></a>‘s holiday party.</p><p>“I was so excited and immediately was like, ‘Where is Sarah Hyland?’ She was on the dance floor somewhere, so I made [Adams] bring me to her,” Pratt told Us. “I was like, ‘Hi! Oh, my gosh. I’ve been dying to meet you. Thank you so much for being such a big Hills fan!’” to which Hyland, 28, responded, “I never watched The Hills.”</p><p>“And I was like, ‘Oh, OK, well, we definitely need to get you on the podcast. Did you hear the trailer? You’re our sign off!’ She goes, ‘No.’ I go, ‘You didn’t hear our trailer?’ She goes, ‘No’ and she’s still dancing, so yeah, it was awkward,” the former Celebrity Big Brother contestant continued. “Then we got in a catfight because I thought we were filming The Hills and I was like, ‘You bitch!’ but then I realized we weren’t and I was like, ‘OK, I don’t have to do that.’ It was a rough start.”</p><p>“I still love Sarah. I never stopped loving her, I’m just a little hurt,” Pratt added, jokingly blaming Adams for exaggerating about the actress being a loyal fan of the MTV series. For his part, Adams insists, “It was a very funny night, like an interesting evening.”</p><p>Despite the initial awkward meeting with his significant other, Pratt — who is starring on The Hills: New Beginnings — is excited about working with Adams on their collaboration, which will feature behind-the-scenes secrets from the MTV revival.</p><p>“Hopefully [it will] become like The Hills after show, different cast members come on and say their opinion and explain themselves about certain episodes. I have a feeling I’m going to be very popular throughout the series,” the Made in Reality author added, joking, “Everyone [will be] like, ‘Stephanie, can I come on? I look really bad in that episode!’”</p><p>The TV personality has certainly earned a fan in her cohost. “I think what I want to get out of this is that after knowing her for, doing this a couple times … you’re perceived differently,” Adams said of Pratt. “If you think that you have haters out there, this will be a good outlet for people to be like, ‘Oh, she’s just a totally normal, honest chick,’ and I think it’ll be a good thing for all.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The first episode of “Pratt Cast” aired on Monday, January 7 — <a href=#>listen to it</a> <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p>With reporting by Carly Sloane</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasrJWltaK6yJ5kqaqRqcFus86tZKKmXZZ6pK3Tn6CgoKRixKrAx2aunqScqHqisMCmqmafmae5p77InqWdZaOWv6K0jKGwpZmemXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
