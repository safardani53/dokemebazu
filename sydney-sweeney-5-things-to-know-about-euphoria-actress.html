I’m just sitting here with my dog Tink, watching HGTV, wearing my Snuggie. People need to be nicer on social media because it’s really f—ked up.”</p><p>Fans <a href=#>rallied to cheer up</a> the crying celeb.</p><p>“If y’all think Sydney Sweeney is ugly idek know what I am,” one user tweeted.</p><p>“Appreciation post for Sydney Sweeney. she’s so talented & has such a beautiful soul,” another praised.</p><p>“I want every single person calling sydney sweeney ugly to do a face reveal right now,” one fan quipped.</p><p>Another added, “I won’t forget y’all for making sydney sweeney cry.”</p><p>“@sydney_sweeney please don’t care about the hate comments. have so much people in this world that love you so much. sending love to tou [sic], we love you,” a fan account wrote. “I LOVE YOU SYDNEY.”</p><p>Even singer <strong>Bea Miller</strong> came out in defense of the actress. “Whoever made sydney sweeney cry drop your location i just wanna talk,” she wrote. “We march at dawn.”</p><p>Previously, Sweeney has admitted she cares what people on the internet think of her. “I’m not gonna lie. I’m not one of those people who’s like, ‘I’m <a href=#>super confident</a>. I don’t care what people think.’ I’m a real person,” she told <a href=#>Collider</a> in November 2020. “I care what people say and what they think and what they comment, so I definitely am always like, ‘oh my god, should I post this?’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She added that cancel culture makes her overthink social media posts often. “I’m terrified of what I’m not aware of or thinking when I post this, and I don’t want to be deaf to anything going on,” she said. “I get really nervous.”</p><p><a href=#>PopCrave</a>, a Twitter account, captured a clip of Sweeney’s Instagram Live, which has been viewed over 133,000 times.
