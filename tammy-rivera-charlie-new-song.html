Released on Mother’s Day (May 10), “CHARLIE” is a sweet tribute to the love only a mother has for her child. This slow R&B groove of a track sees Tammy promising she’ll be by her daughter’s side for “forever and a day.” Tammy sings that though “there will come a time when I won’t always be around / but everything I’ve taught you will be holding you down / I want you to never doubt in your mind/hope you know you’ll always be the apple of my eye.” As to why she decided to share this new song today,&nbsp;Tammy tells&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife</strong> that “The song ‘CHARLIE’ is a true testament to a mother’s love and that’s why I decided to release this on Mother’s Day.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“Charlie marches to her own little beat,” Tammy told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>VH1</a> in 2017. “She’s like the total opposite of me. She’s not a real fashionista. She’s [got] like a little rebellious, not personality but her style. Like, she loves [The Voice’s] <strong>Melanie Martinez</strong>, that’s one of her favorite artists. I can see her being an actress or, or as would say, she’d want to be a YouTuber. When she said that, I was like, ‘ah hell no,’ but then I Googled how much some YouTubers make and I was like, ‘girl, knock yourself out.’” Tammy also said that despite having Tammy and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Waka Flocka Flame </strong></a>as parents, she doesn’t let the spotlight go to her head.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“When her friends are like, ‘Oh my gosh, you’re father’s Waka Flocka Flame,’ she’ll be like, ‘Calm down’!’ She hates sh-t like that,” Waka told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Source </a>in 2018. “She’s not into sh-t that girls that are 13 are into like fashion and knowing what’s on the blogs. She ain’t with that sh-t. As a father, I used to go out with my daughter, and I would see her act out like dance and be loud; and I was like, ‘Yo, why you trying to be seen?’ ”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/tammy-rivera-mothers-day-angel-daughter-charlie-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>“I had to check myself because I seen my daughter, and it’s like she’s in her own world. And I had to respect that, and I had to realize that,” added Waka, who, like Tammy, is proud of the woman that Charlie is growing into. “It’s cool because what I’m building is a classy, strong-minded young lady. Any female that’s like that is prepared for the world.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“CHARLIE” is out now, and new music from Tammy is just around the corner.
