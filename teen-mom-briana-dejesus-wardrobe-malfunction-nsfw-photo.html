Because the flirting and sexual energy between him and Briana is weird as hell!"</p><p>Someone else posted: "The fans need to give it up. Devoin will never hate Briana the way y'all do. He looks so healthy."</p><p>A third wrote alongside a fire emoji: "OKAY DEVOIN I SEE YOU BOO."</p><p>And a fourth added: "Devoin and Bri being on date is just shocking and weird lol."</p><p>That said, both were recently linked to other people.</p><p>In April, Briana&nbsp;<a href=#>revealed her new boyfriend</a> Johnny&nbsp;- in an&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;post of him, whom she tagged and added a red heart emoji.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Meanwhile, Devoin declared his&nbsp;<a href=#>plans to propose</a>&nbsp;to his longtime girlfriend, Jazmine, during an episode of Teen Mom: Family Reunion in January 2022.</p><p>He has yet to address his relationship with Jazmine or whether he popped the question.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/teen-mom-star-brittany-dejesus-851847392-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/teen-mom-fans-lust-briana-832848448-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/abce5303-9ce6-4cd4-887e-758a2dd419e3.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxY2h%2BcX2YaKuenZ5iurC5jJupopmelnqlscmeqq6rXayus7DRqJmeZZ2WuafBzZyroqeeYru0stZmp6GnpKR8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
