Let’s see fan theories on the Bride’s identity.</strong></p><p>Alongside fellow newcomers Gopher and Venus Fly Trap, Bride made his debut on Hall of Fame night as a pink dragon in a wedding dress. They went on to sing Shut Up and Dance With Me by Walk The Moon on the November 9 episode.</p><p>They were so successful that they were crowned Queen&nbsp;for the episode, meaning that Bride will be singing against the Lambs and Harp in the semi-finals. Most unconfirmed guesses are on pro wrestler Chris Jericho behind the mask.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2022/11/GettyImages-1243513390-890x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bride-on-the-masked-singer>Bride on The Masked Singer</h2><p>Bride’s identity has not yet been revealed as of November 10, but fans are making their guesses already. They are appearing in The Masked Singer season 8, wearing a wedding dress, veil, and chunky white shoes.</p><p>They were marked safe after singing Shut Up And Dance by Walk The Moon, several months after the mask was first teased in a preview on August 15 before officially being revealed on August 26.</p><p>Bride, who appeared in week seven of the current season, is the third dragon on The Masked Singer, following Dragon and Hydra. They are also the second dragon to ever sing Shut Up And Dance, after Dragon.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Who is this bride? <a href=#>#themaskedsinger</a></p>— Jenny McC-Wahlberg (@JennyMcCarthy) <a href=#>November 10, 2022</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-guess-bride-is-chris-jericho>Fans guess Bride is Chris Jericho</h2><p>The majority of Twitter watching The Masked Singer believes Bride is Chris Jericho, but this is still unconfirmed.

The Bride claims he has a “rugged personality” and “lives on the road selling out arenas.” He also has an “appetite for destroying things” and was seen breathing fire as a clue.</p><p>“Notorious for being in some of the messiest feuds,” Bride wears a rocker hand, and another with a yellow snake on it. He’s gone “the solo route” but came here to “master a new commitment with all you Masked Singer freaks.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center>WATCH THE MASKED SINGER ON FOX EVERY WEDNESDAY AT 8/7C</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">INSTAGRAM</a><strong>, </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FACEBOOK</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TWITTER</a> AND <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TIKTOK</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfqa6tsc2tZKygn6zAcMDHnmSbqpmZsm67zWakmqubmrFuv8innp6qXZ2utHnFmqWsZWFlfW6vzqedopyVo8FutdOsZJygop7AbrbEq6CcoJ8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
