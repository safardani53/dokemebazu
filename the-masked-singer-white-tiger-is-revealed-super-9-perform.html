Judges <a href=#><strong>Robin Thicke</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Jenny McCarthy</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Ken Jeong</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Nicole Scherzinger</strong></a> watched as the nine final characters took the stage for the first time together during the Wednesday, April 1, episode of <a href=#>The Masked Singer</a>.</p><p>The show opened with a <a href=#>performance by the super nine</a>: Astronaut, Rhino, Night Angel, White Tiger, Kangaroo, Turtle, Banana, Frog and Kitty.</p><p>Before each performance, new clues were revealed. <a href=#>The Kangaroo’s performance of the <strong>Dixie Chicks</strong>‘ “Not Ready to Make Nice”</a> is her response to the “hell” she was put through over the past years. Her super clue was a baby kangaroo and she said, “Alright dolls, do you know who I am now?”</p><p>The judges thought she sounded nervous during this performance. After singing, she also revealed that she’s never actually lived in Australia.</p><p>The turtle revealed that he weighs about 120 pounds but his super clue was a comic book called “The Amazing Adventures of Shellboy.” It had “10:13″ on the cover and the question, “Who’s the hero under the mask?” He also said that he’s not only known for one thing.</p><p><a href=#>The White Tiger’s super clue</a> was of him doing the floss dance moves and shooting a basketball. After performing, he revealed that he doesn’t just dance and sing, but also has written a best-selling book. Meanwhile, the frog’s clue was a statue of a night in shining armor and he sang along to the “Thong Song.” While he definitely could move, he shared that he’s not a trained dancer at all.</p><p>The Banana said that an accident from his past made him forget his lyrics during one performance. His super clue was that he’s worn a mullet. He also cleared up a recent “blue-collar” clue, noting that he’s “a stand-up guy” but “not stand up funny.”</p><p>The Kitty’s new hint was that she loved Christmastime — and the Christmas Tree from last season (Ana Gasteyer). She also said that Robert Redford helped her to get her first role. Meanwhile, the astronaut’s hint was a broken record, but he has never had traditional voice training.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Rhino definitely has. He said that while the judges assume he’s an athlete, music has always been his passion and he’s been on the Billboard charts. Plus, he showed a slot machine and said he’s not as tall as he looks.</p><p>The Night Angel also talked about her singing voice, explaining that she’s not just a great voice but a “mogul.” Her super clue included a tricycle, which the judges thought could mean she’s a triple threat.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>One singer from each group was placed in the bottom after the audience’s votes. White Tiger, Banana and Rhino landed in the bottom three — and the White Tiger was eliminated.</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below for the judges’ guesses and the big reveal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BptaZ5zJqqpJ2UYsCqusaeqWavmJ7BpnnTop6eql2ewG6%2BxK%2BcmqSVmXq0wc%2BeqWZxXaWys7LOq6Ro</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
