Our spouses all conveniently declined the invite. So, here we go! Off to Cartagena."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON ANA NAVARRO">READ MORE ON ANA NAVARRO</h2><p>Unfortunately, as Ana lamented, "so is the rest of Miami."</p><p>She joked: "Our fat butts are wedged in the back of the plane because flights are packed for holiday weekend. It took a village of @americanair agents to get us checked-in because you have to fill out some sort of Colombian immigration form online, and none of us could figure out what state Cartagena is in."</p><p>Finally, Ana and her pals were seated, however, and they were on their way.</p><p>She continued: "But here we are, shvitzing in 18 C. Happy and excited to get our Golden Girls Gone Wild Weekend started! (@kengorin_ is Dorothy. Mario is Rose. Lee is Sophia. And I of course, am Blanche). ¡Colombia, pa’ya vamos!"</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>One of the photos Ana shared found her in a pair of dark sunglasses and a wide-brimmed hat as she prepared for the flight from her seat.</p><p>She and her friends looked excited to be heading out on a fun trip over the long weekend.</p><h2>UNSOLICITED ADVICE</h2><p>Meanwhile, Sunny Hostin has gotten on her co-host’s nerves after making the same comment she’s often made to her on the show.</p><p>Ana snapped at her colleague for irritating her during Friday’s broadcast as Joy Behar tried to calm down the situation.</p><p>During the latest edition of Joy’s Banned Books segment on&nbsp;<a href=#>The View</a>, Sunny cut off Ana while she was speaking, in order to tell her something she said she’s tired of hearing.</p><p>Ana began: “Listen, the problem is that politicians, elected officials, like in my state of Florida, which has gone bananas–“</p><p>Before she could get to the main part of what she wanted to say on the topic,&nbsp;<a href=#>Sunny</a>&nbsp;jumped in with a blunt: “That’s why you should move.”</p><p>Looking exasperated,&nbsp;<a href=#>Ana</a>&nbsp;snapped back: “I’m not gonna move. You tell me that all the time and it irritates me! You don’t move, you fight.”</p><p>Trying to get the discussion back on track before the two could argue further,&nbsp;<a href=#>Joy</a>&nbsp;asked Ana to finish her original thought on the topic.</p><p>Last month, it was during a discussion about a movie being banned in Ana's state of Florida that led to&nbsp;<a href=#>Sunny making the same suggestion</a>.</p><p>Ana said, "This has gotten ridiculous," as her co-host&nbsp;Sunny&nbsp;blurted out: "You gotta move."</p><p>It took a few seconds for Ana to react to Sunny's comment, but when she did, she seemed frustrated.</p><p>"I'm not gonna move!" she screeched, before adding: "I'm gonna stay in Florida and I'm gonna fight from there."</p><p>Ana continued ranting: "So don't tell me to move again! People write me and tell me to move..."</p><p>"I think you'd be happier in New York," mom-of-two Sunny then said calmly as&nbsp;<a href=#>Joy</a>&nbsp;attempted to butt in that time, as well.</p><p>Attempting to explain her outburst, Ana turned to Joy and said: "No, because they tell me that, they tell me to move, I'm not moving!"</p><p>Earlier this week, fans were left stunned after&nbsp;<a href=#>Ana abruptly cut Sunny off</a>&nbsp;during a heated debate.</p><p>The star was in the middle of talking when Ana spoke over her to ask for Whoopi Goldberg's opinion on the topic instead.</p><p>The View&nbsp;panelists kicked off Monday's show with a conversation about the coronation of&nbsp;<a href=#>King Charles III</a>.</p><p>Most of the women agreed that they enjoyed watching the event, but then Sunny turned the conversation more toward the monarchy as a whole.</p><p>She said: "The monarchy built its wealth on the backs of Black and Brown people. And that is just the truth. And that's just the truth of it. But-"</p><p>Sunny was cut off abruptly as Ana spoke up and said, "What did you think of it, Whoopi?"</p><p>Sunny looked a bit annoyed, as she lowered her hands back down to her lap and stayed quiet as Whoopi talked.</p><p>Whoopi continued on with her point, which bounced off of Sunny's.</p><p>One shocked fan tweeted: "Ana just cut Sunny off in the middle of talking! That was rude!"</p><p>"I'm not gonna move!" she screeched, before adding: "I'm gonna stay in Florida and I'm gonna fight from there."</p><p>Ana continued ranting: "So don't tell me to move again!
