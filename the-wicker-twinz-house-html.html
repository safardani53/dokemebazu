It was for their father’s magazine. From there, they continued modeling and did poetry at churches, but they only started gaining traction once they began making dance videos on Dubsmash.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>However, they got their break on Instagram when&nbsp;they uploaded their dance videos and photos at the age of 12. The twins currently have 1.9 million followers on the platform, and their YouTube channel has 687,000 subscribers.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As their followers started growing, the girls began earning, and now at 16, the girls have bought their first home.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Wicker Twinz Buy Their First Home</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>On October 20, the twins uploaded an empty house tour video on YouTube.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The girls started the video by explaining how significant the moment was for them. They explained that while their family did not struggle to get by, they did not have an ideal living situation and shared that they lived with their grandmother in a two-bedroom apartment.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>And since their parents&nbsp;were separated, they lived with their mother because their father lived far away. The house did not have enough space, and so&nbsp;their grandmother would sleep on the couch. The girls used to share a queen-sized bed while their mom&nbsp;slept on the floor beside them.</p><p>It wasn’t until their brother moved to live with their dad that they had their own rooms.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The girls also shared that they did not invite anyone to their house, and only one of their close friends knew about their living situation. Even when the girls had their own rooms, they were afraid to invite people over because they felt they would be judged.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The twins also thanked their mother and grandmother for providing for them and ensuring they had a home.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>They explained that they did not know they were getting a house until their mother took them to the new place and surprised them. They noted that even though it was their first time owning a home, they still lived with their mother.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Wicker Twinz House Tour</h2><p>About halfway through the video, the girls finally kicked off the empty <a href=# rel=follow>house tour</a>, but not before thanking their fans for making it possible.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The girls took viewers around the living room and dining space, although they had not decided how they were going to use the rooms. They then went into the kitchen, and unlike the other rooms, the kitchen was already furnished.&nbsp;</p><p>The girls explained that the kitchen was their favorite spot because they liked to cook and that they would probably be spending time in that room the most.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, they took viewers upstairs to show everyone’s bedrooms and their filming room.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>With that, they concluded the tour and once again thanked their subscribers.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKyYmnq4tcKknKtlpKy2r8aMoaauq5VjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
