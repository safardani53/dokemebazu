Jane Doe, 22, has sued herself and comedian Aries Spears. According to the charges, which Doe filed on behalf of herself and her 15-year-old brother, John Doe, Haddish and Spears coerced them into recording s*xually provocative sequences while they were minors in several humorous skits.</p><p>According to the lawsuit, the plaintiffs were “groomed” when they were seven and fourteen years old, leaving the siblings “traumatized for life.” Tiffany Haddish responded to the situation on her social media channel, opening up about it. She stated:</p><p>“I’m sure folks have a lot of questions. I understand. I’m right by you. Unfortunately, due to an ongoing legal matter, there isn’t much I can say right now. However, although this routine was obviously supposed to be comic, it was not funny at all – and I regret having agreed to appear in it. I truly want to be able to share a lot more about this scenario as soon as possible.”</p><h2>Tiffany Haddish’s allegations</h2><p>Tiffany Haddish and Aries Spears have been sued for intentional infliction of emotional distress, gross negligence, sexual violence, sexual harassment, and sexual abuse of a juvenile. Tiffany Haddish is also accused of being a negligent supervisor who neglected to warn. The comedian is being sued for fiduciary breach and constructive fraud.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tiffany-Haddish1.jpg alt="Tiffany Haddish" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to the complaint information acquired by TMZ, the 14-year-old girl and her 7-year-old brother were pressured into participating in the graphic performance. One of the recordings from the performance allegedly shows Haddish advising the underage girl on how to act out an intimate moment.&nbsp;According to the lawsuit, Haddish allegedly transported the juvenile boy to a residence where she and Spears raped him while filming a Funny Or Die movie titled “Through a Pedophile’s Eyes.”</p><p>Funny Or Die told People Magazine that the reported video was “removed in 2018 soon after becoming aware of its existence.” They went on to say:</p><p>“This video was awful to Funny Or Die, and they would never make such stuff again. We have no involvement in the creation, development, financing, or production of this video. It was posted as user-generated material on the website…”</p><p>According to the complaint, as reported by People:</p><p>“The Plaintiffs were both juveniles who were unable to agree to their participation in sexually explicit recordings produced and uploaded on the ‘Funny or Die’ website… There was no parent or guardian in the room.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Aries-Spears.jpg alt="Aries Spears" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Tiffany Haddish’s lawyer responds</h2><p>In a statement, 14-year-old John Doe claimed that Spears and Haddish offered him a drowsy drink. According to the complaint, Haddish also paid $100 to the siblings.&nbsp;Tiffany Haddish’s attorney, Andrew Brettler, told Variety that the action was “meritless,” and that the kids’ mother had “been attempting to raise these phony allegations against Ms. Haddish for many years.”</p><p>The statement went on to say:</p><p>“Every attorney who first took on her case — and there were many — eventually quit the issue as it became evident that the charges were without substance and Ms. Haddish would not be shaking down.” Ms. Morris is now represented in this action by her adult daughter. They will have to face the repercussions of their silly behavior jointly.”</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirop6Wlru6eceam52ho516tLzEmqKsZZGXvLbAjK2fnmWRobmms8CtoKimXZa7pXnLmq6srZmpeqe1y56bZpqpYreiusRmm6idXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
