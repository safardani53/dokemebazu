During a recent appearance on The Dr. Oz Show, the actor got emotional and started crying while talking about his late mom and his near-fatal skiing accident.</p><p>The Honeymoon in Vegas star, who had a serious accident at Deer Valley in Utah years ago where he fell and hit a tree, suffering a punctured lung, broken ribs, and a broken vertebrae, told Dr. Oz the only person he could think of at that moment was his mother, who had died six months prior.<img decoding=async width=467 height=400 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt=464312920_Tony-Danza- style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>“The reason I fell…is because I [had] lost my mother in June, it was the first Christmas and I had her in my mind,” he told the talk show host before beginning to cry. “I’m so sorry,” he said in between tears. “So I was thinking about her and I fell and hurt myself…Every Christmas you go through this thing where you miss the people who aren’t there anymore…I’m sorry folks, I didn’t mean for this to [happen]. I’m just a bit of a crybaby.”</p><p>Two years after his accident the actor hit the slopes again in 1995. “I was thinking of not skiing anymore,” Danza said during the 1995 Television Critics Association press tour. “I went to see where I got hurt…and then I started to ski, and I spent two and a half weeks up there and…re-fell in love with the sport.”</p><p>Happy Mothers Day to all the mothers all over the world <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/KQydckaeJV</a></p><p>— Tony Danza (@TonyDanza) <a href=#>May 11, 2014</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Every year, the actor also confronts his mother’s death and makes sure to give his mom a shout-out on Mother’s Day.
