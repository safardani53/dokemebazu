I still love delving into a charity shop and sharing my love for hunting out a beautiful bargain.”</p><p>The stylist revealed some of her favourite charity shops - which are perfect for finding designer bargains and rich women’s fancy cast offs.</p><h2>MARYLEBONE</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000672530078.jpg><p>Abbey recommended shoppers head to Marylebone in London if they want to find a good variety of charity shops.&nbsp;</p><p>She said: “There’s a great selection of charity shops and many stock designer brands in excellent condition.&nbsp;</p><p>“Prices are not as cheap as some charity shops but worth it for investment pieces such as a vintage designer bag or coat.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><h2>THAMES HOSPICE IN OLD AMERSHAM&nbsp;</h2><p>Another great charity shop to find designer bargains, is Thames Hospice in Old Amersham, revealed stylish Abbey.</p><p>She said: “A beautifully curated shop which looks and feels like a boutique.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’ve found many wonderful pieces from here including a Tommy Hilfiger denim jacket - timeless.”</p><h2>SHELTER, COAL DROPS YARD, KINGS CROSS</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000689411886.jpg><p>Shelter, Coal Drops Yard at Kings Cross is another great charity shop to browse for designer bargains.&nbsp;</p><p>Stylist Abbey explained it as a ‘total gem.’</p><p>She said: “A total gem of a charity shop which often has new pieces from brands and has a wonderful collection of high-end designer pieces, shoes and handbags.&nbsp;</p><p>“I recently bought a brand new pair of AllSaints boots here which are the most comfortable boots I’ve ever owned and I paid a quarter of the retail price!”</p><h2>OXFAM</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000386125786.jpg><p>Meanwhile she also suggested Oxfam charity shops if you’re hunting for rich women’s fancy cast offs.&nbsp;</p><p>Especially the London stores.</p><p>She said: “So many to choose from though I once found a Paul Costello blazer in the Kings Road store.</p><p>“It has an incredibly curated collection of high-end designer pieces at fair prices which are investment pieces you can love for years to come.”</p><h2>ARUNDEL</h2><p>If you’re looking for designer bargains and rich women’s fancy cast offs, then Arundel is the place to go, suggested expert stylish Abbey.&nbsp;</p><p>She said: “It’s such a beautiful town and home to several fantastic charity shops where I’ve had the pleasure of shopping.&nbsp;</p><p>“My top finds here were a sequin blazer from Hobbs for under £10 and an unusual vintage clutch bag which I always get compliments on.”</p><p>But charity shopping isn’t always easy and Abbey explained that shoppers need to go in with an open mind and willingness to enjoy the experience.</p><p>As sometimes hunting designer bargains down in charity shops can be overwhelming - and not always easy.</p><p>The stylist explained that shoppers need to have an open mind so that they won’t feel disappointed if they don’t find anything they love.</p><p>She said: “It’s not a bargain if you don’t end up wearing it so apply the same thought process to shopping for new clothes and you will enjoy it.</p><p>“You may even come home with something very unique! It is worth checking out charity shops near to where you live as you get to know the type of clothes and accessories they take in.</p><p>“Build relationships with the team of volunteers as they will be able to guide when is a good time to go and may even put pieces by for you that they think you’d like!”</p><p>Abbey also revealed her top tips for people if they’re considering charity shopping for designer bargains.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">ABBEY’S TOP TIPS</h3></p><ul><li>Be open minded, just try it!</li><li>Consider the menswear section especially if you are tall, long in the body or have long arms.</li><li>Talk to the team and the volunteers - they work really hard and a conversation can lighten up their day (plus they know where all the gems are!)</li><li>Make time to browse and enjoy the experience - sometimes you have to delve deep and that’s all part of it.</li><li>Look for good quality brands and great tailoring which is always in style - vintage Jaeger and old M&S (St Michael’s labels) are some of my favourites.</li><li>Consider sizing up if the pieces are older/vintage as we have gotten taller and a little wider over the years.&nbsp;</li><li>Look for charity shops in affluent areas - some of my best buys have been in towns a few miles away but the quality of the brands has been worth the extra miles.</li><li>Consider customising or tailoring pieces you’re looking at to get a great fit - can be worth it and some minor adjustments can elevate a piece very affordably.</li></ul><p>Meanwhile, a woman said her <a href=#>wardrobe is packed with designers like Dolce & Gabbana & Moschino which she bought for pounds.</a></p><p>For more real life stories, check out this&nbsp;<a href=#>woman who was a homeless single mum who couldn’t afford a loaf of bread & is now set to turnover £100k.</a></p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Plus&nbsp;<a href=#>lockdown nearly killed their fashion business but sisters Natalie Reynolds and Lexi Panayi</a>&nbsp;are are making £600k a month selling face masks – and Sam Faiers is a fan.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>I went charity shop hopping in the most expensive part of London and picked up designer items for under £10</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5BvbG1raWuDcMDOqWSfoaaaeqS0wKugrbFdqLWwvNJmmqitnqm%2FunnDnqqin56av26uwKuemqGeqHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
