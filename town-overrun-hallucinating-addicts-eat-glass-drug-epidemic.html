all too common in hard-up towns across Britain as the <a href=#>street drug</a> known as <a href=#>monkey dust</a> rips through communities.</p><p>Last week, it was revealed that <a href=#>Government</a> ministers want to crack down on the terrifying hallucinogen, which is linked to a spate of violent <a href=#>crimes</a> and has even made users eat glass or <a href=#>jump off buildings</a>.</p><p>The synthetic drug — also known as <a href=#>cannibal or zombie dust</a> in the US, where it’s been linked to face-eating attacks — only costs £2 a hit.</p><p>And the off-white powder can be snorted, swallowed or smoked, with the intense high lasting 12 hours, causing extreme aggression and senseless behaviour.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Drugs">Read More on Drugs</h2><p>In <a href=#>Stoke-on-Trent</a>, residents have been left reeling by the spread of the deadly ­substance.</p><p>The recent scene in the <a href=#>North Staffordshire</a> job centre shocked even those used to the sight of junkies, who have turned the area into the UK capital of a new and ­dangerous epidemic.</p><p>Mum-of-two Becky Taylor, 35, whose cousin was once a user, told The Sun of the incident: “It was terrifying.</p><p>“The man was going crazy, smashing things up and running naked through the place.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>“I was scared as I had young kids with me.”</p><p><a href=#>Monkey dust</a> can produce feelings of paranoia, invincibility and ­super-strength.</p><p>One cop said trying to handcuff an abuser was like “tackling the Incredible Hulk”.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Lives destroyed</h2><p>It also makes users overheat, which is why many strip off.</p><p><a href=#>Home Office</a> ministers have asked the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs to look at whether the <a href=#>Class B substance</a> should be moved up to the more serious <a href=#>Class A</a>.</p><p>That would add an extra two years in <a href=#>prison</a> for possession, and the threat of life in jail for dealers.</p><p>Minister for Crime and Policing <a href=#>Chris Philp</a> said: “These synthetic drugs ruin lives, families and ­neighbourhoods.</p><p>“They are made in labs and pumped into our communities.</p><p>“Our drug laws must keep pace with their evolution.”</p><p>Two years ago, Becky’s cousin Ashley Ford, 25, tried to burst into her home at 3am, but got the wrong house and broke in next door.</p><p>The woman and her adult son ­who lived there pushed him into a pantry, but they said naked Ford smashed the glass and attempted to come through the door “like Jack Nicholson in The Shining”.</p><p>He also trashed the house before he was arrested.</p><p>Ford was jailed for 21 months in June 2021 after he admitted unlawful wounding, affray and two counts of criminal damage.</p><p>Becky said: “He had also earlier run down the High Street naked.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TM-Drug-A.jpg> <img

doing crazy things.</p><p>“But he’s turned his life around now and got clean after going to prison.</p><p>“He now has a son and doesn’t touch it any more.”</p><p><a href=#>Monkey dust</a> — with the chemical name methylenedioxypyrovalerone, or MDPV for short — can cause euphoria similar to <a href=#>amphetamine</a> use but may also lead to hallucinations.</p><p>Experts say the effects can occur at low doses, contributing to users becoming addicted.</p><p>Stoke-on-Trent South MP Jack Brereton is pleased the Government is taking action.</p><p>He said: “Many people’s lives have been completely destroyed as a result of taking this drug.</p><p>“There is no treatment for those who become addicted — and it is very addictive.”</p><p>There are no specific official ­statistics for the number of <a href=#>monkey dust</a>-related deaths in the UK.</p><p>But latest data for “new psychoactive substances”, of which the drug is one, showed ­fatalities here rose by 88 per cent in a year, from 137 in 2020 to 258 in 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

the Hanley area of the city one of the worst affected.</p><p>When The Sun visited, a wild-eyed woman in a top hat swayed in the road and gazed at the sky.</p><p>Another female was sticking her head in public rubbish bins, hunting for anything she could sell.</p><p>Retired builder Vasile Calarsu, 56, said: “It’s crazy here.</p><p>“I have seen four people collapsed in the middle of the street.</p><p>“A man set fire to bins in his gardens when he was mad on drugs and burnt the house down.</p><p>“These drugs send people mad.”</p><p>Vasile’s neighbour Jamie Woolley, 30, said users have climbed over a nearby fence and turned a car park into a <a href=#>drugs</a> den.</p><p>The dad-of-two added: “You see them all the time, wandering round here out of it. We know to leave them alone.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Getting worse</h2><p>His partner Lauren Proctor, 24, said: “I was coming out of the shop last week and there was one ­smoking it out of a pipe.</p><p>“They’re always knocking on our door trying to sell stolen stuff.”</p><p>A string of criminals have been given prison sentences at Stoke Crown Court for violent offences committed while under the influence of the drug, while some locals have died.</p><p>In November Mary Stokes, 34, received a 32-month prison term after stabbing a <a href=#>cancer</a> patient twice in the body.</p><p>And James Owens, 29, was sentenced to 26 months after a court heard he tried to “throw his daughter out an upstairs window”.</p><p>In March, Carl Bage, 45, died after falling from a wall while high on a cocktail of drugs including <a href=#>monkey dust</a>.</p><p>And last July, Natasha Johnson, 43, suffered a fatal overdose after mixing it with <a href=#>methadone</a>.</p><p>Staffordshire Police have a team of officers working to cut supplies in the area and recently seized monkey dust worth £100,000.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>But ex-Stoke City football manager Lou Macari, whose is ­trying to tackle homelessness in the area, said recently: “We have a huge problem with monkey dust in Stoke and I’ve seen things I never thought I would witness — people stripping naked because they are convinced there are snakes on the floor, ­paranoia and psychotic episodes.</p><p>“Things here are getting worse, not better.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ390gZRxbmlnpKTEr3nOr5yrqqWjeqmty6WsnKGelsGqusZmmJ2cmZjBtHnEmqtmn5yWwLR5w6usoGWVpbalscyimmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
