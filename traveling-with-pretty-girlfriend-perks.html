"And we're like, okay. This has never happened to me before. When we get up we get the nicer seats with more space and cushioning and all that. I'm like no surprise, she just gets nice stuff all the time."</p><p>He continued, "Okay so we got back to the hotel last night and she's not feeling that great so I run down to get soup at the restaurant. And I bring it up, that's it like nothing special happens. We go down today to get it for lunch, and the woman gives her extra crackers like crackers were never given to me last night."</p><p>Nurm continues to talk about his girlfriend's good fortune, "She shows up, she gets them for free. Like it happens all the time. What was the other one?" he asks, turning to look at his significant other, who he intermittently puts on camera throughout the clip, and she looks at him, smiling as he relays the benefits she enjoys while travelling.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @donurm</span></figure><p>The next "perk" he lists probably wouldn't really be considered a boon, unless a person is welcoming of potential violent encounters with strange men.</p><p>"And then everywhere we go, this is an obvious one, but every guy is staring at her and it's not like, if I see a girl sometimes like I'll look at her for a second, then look down, you know what I mean? Um, every guy holds their gaze when they look at her and then they'll look at me, like they wanna fight or some s---. Like, hello? It's so bizarre."</p><p>A number of commenters remarked that they checked out more of Nurm's videos to get a good look at his girlfriend to see how his main <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">squeeze is able to benefit from such pretty privilege</a> and it appears that there were a lot of folks who said that she's not only beautiful, but that she appears to have a kind "aura" that people probably find so arresting.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @donurm</span></figure><p>"Ok I checked. she's not only pretty, she has a kind face!! she looks genuinely very nice," one person wrote.</p><p>Another remarked, "Besides being pretty she probably also has very kind/good energy !!"</p><p>Someone else stated that this was indeed an example of "pretty privilege" in action and that they, too, are often on the receiving end of its benefits.</p><p>"yep, pretty privilege is a thing, it's also self confidence is magnetic to others. My friends & hubby have noticed this happens to me," the commenter wrote.</p><p>There have been several studies that have delved into the idea that "pretty privilege" is most certainly a real social construct that sees folks who are deemed to be more physically attractive than others receive preferential treatment because they hit the genetic lottery.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @donurm</span></figure><p>Bond University discussed this concept, writing: "It may be a hard truth to accept, but the beautiful amongst us benefit from a kind of discrimination that privileges physical attractiveness. Life simply seems to be kinder to the physically blessed."</p><p>The idea that beauty is inherently tied to an inherent bias that leads folks to believe someone possesses a higher ethical standard or are de facto just "good" people dates back to ancient <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Greek times with a concept called "kalos kagathos."</a></p><p>But immediate physical attraction accounts for only a portion of a person's painted perception of an individual they immediately meet — there is a plethora of research that indicates one's personality, i.e. folks with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">more genuinely positive personalities, are also seen to be more beautiful</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @donurm</span></figure><p>To use a modern day example: let's say you match with someone on a dating application and while they may not look like an absolute smoke show in their pictures, you're positively smitten with them upon meeting them in person and find that you're drawn to them by the virtue of their actions and content of their character.</p><p>Have you ever experienced pretty privilege, or have a friend or loved one you found was immediately accepted into any group/gathering they walked into and received little perks just by how they looked?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqb%2BiwsSloKefXay2tbSMqamerKSueqi10aWdq6GVo7FuvMSroqw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
