Both proceeded to wipe each other from their respective social media accounts.</p><h3>November 2020</h3><p>Kelce confirmed he and Nicole were back together during a live video with WNBA star <strong>Chiney Ogwumike</strong>. “So obviously we’ve got the fam. Mom, dad, brother Jason — big grizzly guy. Then my girlfriend Kayla,” he said in a joint <a href=# rel=noopener>TMZ</a> interview with the Los Angeles Sparks player. “Kayla is definitely on the list. Always got to do it big for Kayla.”</p><h3>February 2022</h3><p>The pair attended the 11th Annual NFL Honors together and stepped out for a hockey double date with <a href=#><strong>Patrick</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Brittany Mahomes</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Travis-Kelce-and-Ex-Girlfriend-Kayla-Nicole-Relationship-Timeline-2.jpg><h3>May 2022</h3><p>Kelce and Nicole split for good less than two years after their reconciliation. <a href=#>Barstool Sports</a> reported at the time the relationship ended because Kelce forced Nicole to pay for half of everything they did together. Nicole denied the outlet’s claims, calling them garbage and incorrect via X (formerly Twitter). In a since-deleted TikTok video, Nicole said she felt stupid for thinking their longtime romance would end in marriage.</p><p>That September, Nicole poked fun at the media attention she received because of the breakup in a hilarious <a href=# rel=noopener>TikTok</a> post. “When I do literally anything at all on this here internet,” she captioned a video of herself using a video filter to look like she was being chased by police.</p><h3>January 2023</h3><p>Kelce addressed the “crazy” rumors that he and Nicole broke up because he was “too cheap” during an interview on <a href=# rel=noopener>“The Pivot Podcast.”</a> He explained: “Don’t buy into that s—t. I would never say that I was supporting [her]. She had a very financially stable life and what she was doing in her career.”</p><p>Kelce noted that they each lent each other money once in a while to pay for things such as food. “I mean, we were in a relationship for five years,” he added. “A hundred dollars here and a hundred dollars there wasn’t even thought about.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Travis-Kelce-and-Ex-Girlfriend-Kayla-Nicole-Relationship-Timeline-1.jpg><h3>October 2023</h3><p>Nicole seemingly shaded her ex and internet trolls in a lengthy <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> video as Kelce <a href=#>continued to make headlines</a> for his relationship with <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>.</p><p>“Dear Black girl, they may call you a traitor for falling in love. You’ll hope the ones closest will protect you, but you will quickly find out that people don’t protect what they don’t value,” she said into the camera. “They’ll say you’re too much, too provocative, too boisterous, too outspoken. And in the same breath tell you you’re not enough. Not successful enough, not wholesome enough, maybe not even intelligent enough. They’ll say you deserve the backlash and embarrassment. Because of your blackness, you should have known better. They’ll even try to tie your value to your net worth.”</p><p>Nicole continued: “You don’t have to participate in this tumultuous, often one-sided journey. Preserve your heart even when they try to quantify your character and best your boundaries you do not have to engage. You do not have to respond. because there is power in your silence. and you can use that same power to silence the noise and the self-doubt.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3>October 2023</h3><p>Nicole revealed to <a href=# rel=noopener>People</a> that her mental and physical health suffered after going through a <a href=#>“major breakup and major life change”</a> in 2022, the same year as her and Kelce’s split. Following the breakup, she decided to begin therapy to help improve her mental and physical wellbeing.</p><p>“Had I not [gone to therapy], I don’t know how I would be reacting in the moment right now,” she added, seemingly referring to <a href=#>Kelce and Swift’s romance</a>. Nicole noted she wished she could tell her past self to “buckle the f—k up” for 2023, stating, “You thought the worst had already come, but buckle up and take all of the tools right now and put them in your bag because you’re going to need them.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatqpGrtrR5yp6jnJ1dlrulecSxZKChoqGzs7XEp5tmo5GuuaJ5zaKaqKSVqHqzscuaq6Knnqi1qryMraCmnZyeu6Z7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
