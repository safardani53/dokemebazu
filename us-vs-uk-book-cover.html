Here’s the scoop — plus, inside the limited-edition book covers that gave TikTok users pause.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why are there differences between U.S. and U.K. book covers?</h2><p>Several important factors contribute to differences in U.S. and U.K. book covers (and other international editions!), including marketing budgets and which book covers sell better in each location. Noticing differences between editions isn't exactly a new phenomenon, but one that could likely be credited to the rise of social media — when posting your bookshelves on TikTok or Instagram became a surefire way to attract fellow book lovers.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Marketing and design budgets are a factor in what cover designs look like.</h2><p>Despite most of the “Big 5” publishers (Penguin Random House, Macmillan, Simon & Schuster, Hachette Book Group, HarperCollins) having international arms, their marketing and design budgets for covers may differ drastically.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Penguin U.K. website</a>, creating cover art can be an immense effort, as it takes collaboration between designers, editors, marketing, sales, and production teams.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Additionally, there is a competitor in the market: ebooks. Designer and illustrator Neil Gower told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a> in 2017 that publishing houses are motivated to create more beautiful designs to compete with ebooks, as print books are rapidly rising in price in comparison. Sometimes designers add deckled or sprayed edges for a little extra oomph.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Book cover tastes in the U.S. and U.K. differ as well.</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MPR News</a>, tastes in book covers differ notably in the U.S. and the U.K. For example, "British covers defer to darker colors or more negative space, while American covers tend to be flashier."</p><p>Jacket designer Stuart Bache told The Guardian that U.S. designs veer toward "literal interpretation" (including photos of real people) vs. the covers in the U.K. that don't want to give away too much of the story, lest readers find themselves lacking intrigue to purchase.</p><p>There are, however, noticeable similarities in book cover trends internationally: Booksellers across the globe are leaning more toward bold colors, hand-drawn typography, and overall a more handcrafted touch.</p><p>Readers across the board have also noticed trends within genres; for example, in the U.S., if a book has a shadowy photo of a location (such as a house or a hotel room) and a title in a handwritten, all-caps font, that book is likely to be a thriller. But if the font is handwritten cursive, it may be a rom-com!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">In 2023, Indigo Editions released limited-edition book covers of popular YA books — and TikTok wasn’t having it.</h2><p>In a TikTok on June 30, 2023, user @lovelyliterary, better known as Jordan Murray, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a video</a> featuring popular YA book covers reimagined for Canadian bookseller Indigo. The original covers varied stylistically across several genres, such as dark academia, fantasy, and contemporary, but the Indigo editions turned them all into pastels.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Immediately, users on social media began to comment on the covers. "These indigo editions are undefeated at being really bad. Mad respect, honestly.
