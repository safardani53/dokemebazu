Like, if you’re not feeding, you’re pumping. … There’s just so much that goes into it.”</p><p>The new mom added that the beginning was more difficult for her. “I could not tell if he was getting [any milk],” she told Us. “I know he only needed a small amount, but even now sometimes I get so worried. He’s, like, not fully satisfied because I can’t see how much is going into him. And it freaks me out a little bit. I love the bonding experience and stuff, but sometimes pumping and putting it into a bottle where I can physically see how much he’s getting, feels more [satisfying]. I’m trying to figure out what’s best for him right now. It’s super scary to say he might not be getting enough when he’s just on my breasts. I’m sure he probably is.”</p><p>As for Kent, the Give Them Lala author exclusively told Us in May 2021 that she was “prepared” for breast-feeding to not be an easy process — but her experience with daughter <a href=#>Ocean</a> was “amazing.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Utah native said, “My mom had told me she wasn’t able to breast-feed because her milk wasn’t coming in. I wasn’t latching. So I knew right off the bat that breast-feeding was not something that you just get to do. … This whole thing is, like, a hit or miss. Sometimes it works out. Sometimes it doesn’t, which is why I find it so weird that people ask like, ‘Are you going to breast-feed?’ No. 1, I may not want to, because it can be very isolating. And No. 2, I hope I can.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see more Bravo personalities nursing their little ones, from<a href=#><strong> Stassi Schroeder</strong> </a>to <a href=#><strong>Scheana Shay</strong></a>:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkw6K6w56pqa2dpXqzwcueqmarpJa%2FtHnBq5yaq6Ris6axw6KloGWgnby1u9JmqpyglZa7onnSoZiyZZyWuaJ5yp6lrWWRo7Fuuc6rnGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
