For the past decade, she’s been in a committed relationship with <strong>John Donaldson,&nbsp;</strong>who clearly makes her very happy! Keep reading to find out more about John and Vanna’s relationship as well as her past loves!</p><h2>Vanna White has been dating John Donaldson since 2012</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Vanna-White-John-Donaldson-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Vanna and John first started going out in 2012, and it’s clear that the pair have amazing chemistry together! The game show personality opened up about her ideal date night with her beau in a 2019 interview with<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;Closer Weekly.</a> “It would be a very simple dinner with a bottle of wine,” she told the outlet. “At home or at a restaurant, you know. As long as I’m not cooking!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The pair seem to have a great relationship, and it looks like John gets along great with Vanna’s two kids. The&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Wheel of Fortune&nbsp;hostess</a> has shared plenty of photos of herself with John and her grownup children on her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>, showing them celebrating holidays as a family. She’s gushed about John in interviews. “He is kind, understanding, and lets me be me,” she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Closer</a>&nbsp;in 2016. “Today I am happy just the way things are. The biggest surprise to my fans is probably how simple I live in real life.”</p><h2>John is a Contractor</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>While Vanna is a<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> show business icon</a>, John has been a business owner for about 30 years. He owns a contracting couple, which he began in 1992 and formally incorporated in 1998, according <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>to his website</a>. As a contractor, he’s worked on homes for stars like&nbsp;<strong>Richard Dreyfuss&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Dan Akroyd,&nbsp;</strong>but he has skills that are perfect for a wide array of jobs. “For more than two decades JDC has been trusted by individuals, families and institutions throughout Southern and Northern California to complete a variety of residential property renovations, from custom single family homes to apartment communities ranging from 100 to 600 units,” his website says.</p><h2>Are they planning on getting married?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Now that they’ve been together for about a decade, fans have wondered whether there are wedding bells in the air for Vanna and John. A source close to the hostess hinted that she was looking to tie the knot with John in June 2019, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>OK! Magazine</a>.&nbsp;“She wants to be married before she turns 65 next February,” they said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Despite the report, the pair are not married, and it doesn’t seem like the ring is very important to Vanna. “We feel married,” she told&nbsp;Closer&nbsp;in 2019. “So I don’t think you necessarily have to have a piece of paper unless you want to. Everybody’s different, so for each his own.”</p><h2>Vanna’s first husband was George Santo Pietro</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Vanna-White-John-Donaldson-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>While Vanna may not seem like she’s in a hurry to get hitched to John, she was married once before to&nbsp;<strong>George Santo Pietro&nbsp;</strong>from 1990 to 2002. The exes <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>share two kids:</a> a son <strong>Nikko,&nbsp;</strong>28, and daughter&nbsp;<strong>Gigi,&nbsp;</strong>25. While the pair have mostly kept quiet about their relationship, they did reveal that Vanna was pregnant during a puzzle on&nbsp;Wheel&nbsp;in 1992, but she sadly suffered a miscarriage shortly after. She opened up about the heartbreak of the miscarriage in a 2019 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>.&nbsp;“Obviously I lost the baby, which was devastating after announcing it. The good news is I was able to get pregnant again and had two beautiful, healthy children,” she said. “But losing a child — there’s nothing good about that.”</p><h2>She was engaged two other times</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>Besides her marriage to George, Vanna was planning on walking down the aisle on at least two other occasions. She got engaged to dancer and actor&nbsp;<strong>John Gibson&nbsp;</strong>in the 80s. John was tragically killed in a plane crash in May 1986. She opened up about fans from the show sharing their stories about similar experiences with her in the above-mentioned People&nbsp;interview. “I heard from so many people who had shared the same experience of losing someone instantly in an accident, and that really helped me. I didn’t feel like I was alone,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>After her divorce from George, Vanna began dating businessman&nbsp;<strong>Michael Kaye.&nbsp;</strong>The couple got engaged in 2004, but they never exchanged vows, and the pair have since split up. Of course, a few years later, she met her current boyfriend, and they seem so in love!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9WapaeZXay1qsDEZp%2Buq5KWu6V5k3FncmlgZXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
