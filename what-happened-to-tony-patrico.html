The Point announced that Tony would be leaving the station in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">social media post</a> on Jan. 4, 2023, saying, “Tony Patrico is no longer with Hubbard Radio or a member of The Rizzuto Show.

After the news was posted that he had left The Point, women began chiming in with their own stories about the inappropriate comments he had made.</p><p>"Just want to say thank you to the individuals that did come forward because I’ve received messages from him over the span of a good 3–4 years (via Snapchat and Instagram) and never had the guts to speak up about it," one person wrote.</p><p>"He messaged me on twitter saying he had a dirty dream about me after i had taken a selfie with him and the crew after an event. His baby was like 2 weeks old," another person added.</p><p>If these comments and others are to be believed, Tony engaged in this behavior with some frequency, and did so while he was married.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tony's co-host addressed his departure on air.</h2><p>In addition to the official statement about Tony's departure, his co-host Scott Rizzuto recorded an audio message. Scott said that he couldn't go into the details of the case in part because it was a personnel issue.</p><p>“We cannot get into the specifics of it,” he said. “All I can say –– and I’m speaking for all of us here –– we are in complete shock. To say the last couple of days have been difficult is the understatement of the century."</p><p>"And we’re still all processing everything that happened," the host continued. "We’re sad, we’re devastated. We have spoken with Tony. He is our friend. But this is really hard. Again, speaking for all of us here on the show, we have nothing but compassion and empathy for everyone involved in the situation.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGStp56uerGt06ugnKc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
