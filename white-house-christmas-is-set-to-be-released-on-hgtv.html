First Lady Jill Biden will come on the program and take the hosts on a tour of the decorated White House, which was decorated by more than 150 volunteers.</p><p>According to HGTV’s news release,</p><p>“We the People,” this year’s theme, “will reflect the spirit of America’s shared ideals and the confidence in potential, optimism, and togetherness – a reminder that we are stronger together than apart.”</p><p>It goes on:</p><p>“Over 83,615-holiday lights, 77 Christmas trees, 300 candles, 12,000 ornaments, 1,600 bells, nearly 14,865 feet of ribbon, and numerous décor pieces that can be duplicated directly at home” will bring the concept to life.&nbsp;White House Christmas will premiere on HGTV on Sunday, December 11, at 6 p.m. ET, and on Discovery+ the same day.</p><h2>What to look forward to at the White House Christmas in 2022</h2><p>On December 11, HGTV will film its annual Christmas special, which will feature actress Zooey Deschanel and television personality Jonathan Scott at the People’s House to depict what it looks like during the holiday season. The theme for this year is ‘We the People,’ and the White House will highlight what the nation stands for and its rich past.</p><p>Scott told The Hills in an interview:</p><p>“Everyone, including me, is represented, regardless of where they reside geographically. I just recently become an American citizen, so being able to enjoy the rich history that America has to offer means a lot to me; this is an exciting day.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/White-House-Christmas-1.jpg alt="White House Christmas" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>This year’s White House Christmas has over 83,600-holiday lights, 25 wreaths, and 77 Christmas trees, with over 50,000 visitors expected over the holiday season. The famed gingerbread White House will also be on display, with 20 sheets of sugar cookie dough, 30 sheets of gingerbread dough, and 30 pounds of chocolate. In addition, a sugar cookie replica of Philadelphia’s Independence Hall has been built for 2022.</p><p>The State Dining Room will display Christmas decorations with self-portraits of the 2021 Teachers of the Year from throughout the country. Similarly, to honor the deceased military members and their families, the East Wing will exhibit Christmas trees with mirrored gold star ornaments imprinted with their names.</p><p>The White Mansion Christmas will also include a menorah made from wood taken from the house during a Truman-era refurbishment. The hosts, on the other hand, will be doing more than simply looking around. A behind-the-scenes episode will include Scott decorating the official White House Christmas Tree as Zooey decorates the corridors and completes the Gingerbread House.&nbsp;The program has been on the air for nearly two decades, according to Jane Latman, head of the home and culinary content and streaming at Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc., and it honors the “effort and magic” that goes into decorating the White House.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/White-House-Christmas-2.jpg alt="White House Christmas" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She went on to say:</p><p>“We’ll provide the warmth of the season once again with a visual feast to please the whole family. We the People, the message woven throughout this year’s theme, reminds us that it is our coming together that makes the holidays memorable, so wrap up beneath a warm blanket and enjoy the enchantment with your loved ones.”</p><p>On December 11, at 6 p.m. ET, HGTV will show White House Christmas, which will also be accessible on Discovery+ and HGTV GO.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>HGTV</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>White House Christmas</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaGkmnqpu9SsnGabmKe2tMDMmqpmoaNiwKbAjK2mZpqVYr%2BmuMSaqp6cXaS7brTGra1o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
