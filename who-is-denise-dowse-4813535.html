Her passing was confirmed via social media by her sister Tracey on Saturday, Aug. 13. “I want to take this moment to thank our friends and family for all of the love and prayers,” Tracey penned. “It is with a very heavy heart that I inform everyone that my sister, Denise Dowse, has gone forward to meet our family in eternal life,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“Denise Yvonne Dowse was the most amazing sister, a consummate, illustrious actress, mentor and director. She was my very best friend and final family member. Denise loved all of you. I know that she is watching over us with all the love she has,” Tracey signed off.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Dowse built her career on a strong foundation.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, she notably played Ray Charles’ manager <strong>Marlene Andre</strong> opposite <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jamie Foxx</strong></a> in 2004 drama Ray.</p><h2>Denise is an accomplished director.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>The actress is also accomplished behind the camera — her IMDb page credits her as a director on 2 productions, including Remember Me: The Mahalia Jackson Story, which appears to be in post-production. The film stars <strong>Vanessa Williams, Corbin Bleu</strong>, and <strong>Keith David</strong>. Her other director’s credit is for a 2004 short, entitled Reflections: A Story of Redemption.
