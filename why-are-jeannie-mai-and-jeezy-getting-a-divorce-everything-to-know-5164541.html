Over two months after Jeezy <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>filed for divorce</a> after two years of marriage, the 46-year-old rapper requested a court hearing to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>work out the custody</a> of their 1-year-old daughter <strong>Monaco</strong>. In her response, Jeannie, 44, insinuated that Jeezy cheated on her. Keep reading to learn all about Jeannie Mai and Jeezy’s abrupt separation.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Why Are Jeannie Mai and Jeezy Getting a Divorce?<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-3>In his September 14 court filing, Jeezy cited that his marriage to Jeannie was “irretrievably broken” as the reason behind their divorce. He also noted that there is “no hope for reconciliation,” according to<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i> The Hollywood Reporter</i></a>. The “Mr. President” artist requested joint legal custody of his and Jeannie’s child. Per his filing, Jeezy expects that their prenuptial agreement will be enforced. However, the details of the prenup have not yet been revealed.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>One month later, Jeezy provided a statement to<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> E! News</a> that read, “The decision to end this chapter in my life was not made impulsively and comes with a heavy heart. Despite this, my love and respect for Jeannie remains and the time we spent together holds a cherished place in my heart.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Though the estranged spouses have only been married for two years, fans were shocked at the news of their split. Previously, Jeannie opened up in an exclusive interview with <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Hollywood Life</a></strong> about why she chose to take Jeezy’s last name upon getting married.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-6><span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>“My husband is a beautiful human being let alone a legend in these streets and his name, his last name to me means a man who has survived so much and who has triumphed and has beat the odds in a way that many people can’t tell,” Jeannie told <strong>Hollywood Life</strong> in 2021. “So, today, being Jeannie Mai Jenkins, I am proud to carry his name and to bring everything I can to put even more purpose and even more value into what he already has.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Amid their ongoing divorce, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a> reported that the estranged spouses are still living together but rarely communicate.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Jeannie and Jeezy’s split was reportedly inevitable, according to a report from <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>. A source told the publication, “They’ve had issues for a long time, but things got really hard over the last few months. He spends nearly all his time in Atlanta, and she was flying back and forth between there and L.A. She was scaling back a bit and trying to spend more time in Atlanta to work on their issues.”</p><h2>How Long Were Jeezy and Jeannie Mai Together?<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>The duo first met when Jeezy was a guest on Jeannie’s show in 2018. They <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>later tied the knot</a> in March 2021 in their Atlanta-based home. The then-newlyweds chose to keep their nuptials away from the public eye, which Jeannie exclusively told <i>HollywoodLife</i> was a “sacred” decision. <span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“That was a big decision for us because we have been really public and our relationship,” the talk show host added in her 2021 interview. “Sometimes, we chose it to be or not really public, and I’m on a talk show. So, I would share with you guys what it was like to fall in love with Jeezy and to find our way together. But there were certain things that we wanted to save for us, and our marriage was so sacred. You don’t want to plan something really special and wonder if TMZ lenses are going to be through my trees.”</p><h2>Did Jeannie Mai and Jeezy Cheat on Each Other?<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>Jeannie insinuated that <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jeezy cheated on her</a> in her court filing from December 1. Her lawyer mentioned that the former couple’s prenuptial agreement states that that “infidelity” would “result in a significant financial penalty upon the adulterous party.” This was in response to Jeezy claiming in his own court filing that Jeannie has been “gatekeeping” their daughter since their split. Jeezy requested a hearing to “address temporary custodial arrangements” of Monaco.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Fans were already speculation that a cheating scandal took place between Jeannie and Jeezy, leading to their sudden separation. Some pointed to Jeannie’s apparent on-screen “chemistry” with <i>Access</i> host Mario Lopez in an Instagram video she posted in August. During one moment in her montage clip, Mario was seen holding up her and Jeezy’s daughter and kissing her on the cheek, which many fans disagreed with.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-13>“You do not kiss another man’s child like that, that was very disrespectful and I bet Jeannie never said a word to him about that,” one person commented under the video shortly after Jeezy filed for divorce from Jeannie.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-14>While the rumors appear to be baseless, Jeezy shared a cryptic Instagram caption one day before he filed for divorce, as he wrote, “Too focused on who I’m becoming to focus on who’s not coming with me.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Do Jeannie Mai and Jeezy Have Kids?<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>The television personality and the “Soul Survivor” rapper share one child together: daughter Monaco Mai Jenkins, whom Jeannie and Jeezy <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcomed in 2022</a>. In addition to Monaco, Jeezy also shares <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>son Jadarius</a> with his ex<b> Tynesha Dykes</b> and daughter Amra with ex <b>Mahlet “Mahi” Gebremedhin</b>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahsGaZopp6q7HAp6WinV2irqp5wKebZqKVmse6ecaeq62hnpx6onnDoq2oqpOaeqbCxKuwraCZo7RuwM5moqenp2KCcoKTbmtqZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
