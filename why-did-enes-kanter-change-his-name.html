Born in Switzerland to Turkish parents, Enes and his family eventually relocated to Turkey, where he remained until he moved to the United States in 2009 to play basketball.</p><p>As he grew older, Enes became outspoken about the rule of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in his homeland of Turkey, publicly denouncing him as a corrupt leader. In 2017, Enes had his Turkish passport revoked; the following year, his father was briefly imprisoned by the Turkish government and charged as a member of a terrorist group.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Mere days after his passport cancelation, the Turkish government issued an arrest warrant for Enes. The government claimed he was a member of an Islamist fraternal movement known as Hizmet.</p><p>As of Nov. 2021, Enes is still as vocal as ever on human rights issues worldwide, including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nike's forced labor practices</a> in China. Even better, he officially became an American citizen on Nov. 29, 2021, and announced he would legally change his name to Enes Kanter Freedom.</p><p>Now, if you were unaware of the change, then you might've been confused watching the recent Celtics games.

I turned around and was like, ‘Dude, what are you doing? They’re going to throw you in jail.’ He turned around and started laughing at me. He was like, ‘Brother, don’t worry about it. This is not Turkey.’"</p><p>He added, "But in America, obviously, people are very blessed to be in this situation. They have freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of expression, freedom of [the] press."</p><p>"You guys are doing your jobs, but some of your colleagues overseas in many countries, especially the Middle East, because they’re are doing their jobs, they’re in jails," he continued. "Especially people in Turkey, there are so many political prisoners, there are so many journalists who are in jail right now."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Enes Kanter FREEDOM (@enesfreedom)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Enes also said he wanted Freedom to be a part of his identity because "that was the word that I fought for my whole life. That was the word that I try to stand up [for] my whole life. To me, it was really important, and that was the reason.”</p><p>Mr. Freedom, the name suits you so well, and we can not wait to see where life takes you! Hopefully, it will take you to a bright future full of human rights activism and even a few NBA championships.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2adnprAbrfAp6ueql2YtaK6xp5koaGjYruiucQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
