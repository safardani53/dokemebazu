So, is there a future for this reality show? Will there be a Winter House Season 4?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Bravo hasn’t said whether ‘Winter House’ Season 4 is a go.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Bravo hasn’t announced a fourth season for Winter House yet, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Screen Rant</a> notes. According to that site, Winter House seasons tend to film in the early months of the year, so we might see Bravo stars converging for a fourth Winter House season in a matter of weeks if the cable channel renews the show.</p><p>Winter House’s ratings might give us a sense of the Season 4 prospects. So far, viewership totals for Winter House Season 3 have ranged between 310,000 and 398,000 viewers, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Deets</a>. In contrast, the episodes for Season 2 drew in between 344,000 and 507,000 viewers, according to the site. There has been a definite dip in the ratings.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Bravo is airing Real Housewives of Salt Lake City Season 4 concurrently, and that show hit a season high in total viewers on Nov. 28, 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">with 565,000 fans tuning in</a>, TV Deets reports. Therefore, it seems Winter House isn’t one of Bravo’s top performers, and we wouldn’t assume a fourth season is a lock.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There’s still a lot of drama to come in Season 3.</h2><p>BravoTV.com’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Dish</a> blog recently hyped up a forthcoming Winter House Season 3 reunion, for which Andy Cohen brought together the whole cast: Summer House’s Amanda Batula, Kyle Cooke, Sam Feher, and Danielle Olivera; the Below Deck franchise’s Katie Flood, Alex Propson, and Malia White; Vanderpump Rules’s Tom Schwartz; Winter House’s Kory Keefer; Summer House: Martha’s Vineyard’s Jordan Emanuel; Family Karma’s Brian Benni, and Bravo newcomer Casey Craig,</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Katie and Alex gave fans teases about the reunion drama to come during their Dec. 6 appearance on Watch What Happens Live, as they returned to the same studio where that cast get-together was filmed. “Some people came in a little bit too hot for my liking,” she observed. “And yeah, we’ll leave it at that.”</p><p>Alex added, “I felt like there were some pent-up things that just had to explode, and they exploded. And it was a lot of fun.”</p><p>Even with that tension, though, Tom seems to think this reunion was more enjoyable than those he’s used to on Vanderpump Rules. “This feels different because usually I go into a reunion, like the last one, I was terrified,” the Winter House first-timer explained to BravoTV.com. “[Now], I feel great. This is like a family reunion. Love is in the air.”</p><p>Winter House airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLavwMSrZKGnpaiybr%2FEmqqopl1p</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
